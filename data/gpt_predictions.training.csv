NCT04024969,"There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a 'lumbar puncture' (a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine). Patients often report they find it painful and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisations or time off work to recover.

Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case. Doctors do not find abnormalities in everyone who has MS but some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both of these problems can lead to misdiagnosis.

A new MRI scan allows doctors to see small veins that run through damaged areas of the brain in people with MS. It has been shown that this is a specific finding to MS, seldom seen in other conditions. It is not painful and carries few or no risks.

This research aims to change the way people are diagnosed with MS and reduce the number of lumbar punctures used. The investigators will recruit a large number of people from different hospitals whose doctors suspect they may have MS. They will be invited to have the new eight-minute MRI scan. After 18 months, the investigators will find out what diagnosis is eventually reached and compare this to the finding of the new scan. The investigators will then compare the accuracy, speed, costs and acceptability of the different tests needed to make a diagnosis of MS and establish if most lumbar punctures can be replaced by a slightly longer MRI scan. This research could provide the National Health Service with a scientific approach to diagnose MS which is safer, more cost effective and importantly, more acceptable to patients.",['MRI scan'],['']

NCT05620524,"Traditional dosing of 5-FU is based on body surface area and DPD enzyme activity. However, BSA-based dosing is associated with wide inter-individual variations in 5-FU systemic exposure, and also 5-FU-induced toxicity. The international association for therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical toxicology (IATDMCT) state in there clinical guideline, in which all previous clinical pharmacokinetic studies of 5-FU were reviewed, that only 25% of the patients are within the therapeutic range. In the traditional treatment regimens a bolus of 400 mg/ m2 5-FU is given, followed by a dose of 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour infusion. The therapeutic range of 5-FU in these older regimens is defined by a target AUC of 20-30 mg\*h/L. In contrast, 5-FU in FLOT regimen is given without a bolus, and in a high dose of 2600 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion. This means that a comparable absolute dose of 5-FU is given with FLOT and the older regimens, however, the manner and duration of administration differ. Based on this administration, it is expected that the FLOT regimen will result in an approximately two-fold higher steady state concentration (Css), as it is given in an approximately two-fold shorter period of time (t). As a result of this pharmacokinetic predictions, the exposure to 5-FU (AUC = Css x t) will be comparable between these different 5-FU regimens. Therefore, we hypothesise that the therapeutic range of 5-FU in FLOT will be comparable to the target AUC of 20-30 mg\*h/L in the older regimens. Similar to the older treatment regimens, we expect that a significant part of patients will be outside this therapeutic window. To test these hypotheses, the aim of this study is to establish the population exposure of 5-FU in FLOT treatment regimen, and to determine the percentage of patients that achieves this therapeutic range.","['5-FU', 'fluorouracil']","['fluorouracil', 'fluorouracil']"

We also classified patients according to their response to Mini mental State of Examination (MMSE). Finally we saw the polymorphisms of APO E and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and tried to correlate the response with different allelic forms of Apo E and among others with wild type homozygotes (wt/wt) and their polymorphisms (CYP2D6\*3,\*4, \*5, \*6 and 10) of CYP 2D6.

Patients and Methods: 129 patients were diagnosed as AD or AD+cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mild or moderate. After 12 month-treatment, 97 patients completed the study. They were assessed (four) times. In the first visit, without taking ChEI, after 3, 6 and 12 month-treatment, they were taking donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine. We also extracted 5 mL of blood sample to genotype the DNA. In each visit, we applied cognitive, functional, mood and behavior scales. Good responders were defined as those who scored \> 2 in MMSE.

Results and Conclusion: In longitudinal analysis, patients with mild AD and good responders at 3 months were considered good responders at 12 months.

NCT04346511,"Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are both leading causes of death in the United States. Epidemiological data have shown that increased prevalence of hypertension is related to these outcomes. However, despite the strong association of poor brain health outcomes in patients with hypertension (HTN), the understanding of cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation and treatment options for HTN remain limited. Acupuncture treatment (AT), which is considered a promising complementary and integrative modality, has been known to reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function in HTN. However, very few studies have investigated AT's effect on cerebrovascular function and the possible neuroprotective properties directly via regulating HTN. Exercise is used as a stimulus that increases the brain's metabolism and requires cerebrovascular responses (vasodilation) to meet the new metabolism.

NCT01407484,"BACKGROUND: One couple out of 6 consults for infertility during their sexual life. In 60% of cases a male factor is associated or is the main infertility factor. Inflammatory Syndrome (IS), characterized by the presence of a leukocytospermia is found in 12% of the cases. Leukocyte degranulation causes oxidative stress (OS) through the formation of free radicals attacking the sperm cell functions.

HYPOTHESIS: To establish the responsibility of the IS, and OS, in chronicle inflammatory male infertility, the investigators hypothesize that its treatment (as well as its possible cause) must restore or improve the fertilizing capacity of patients sperm.

METHODS: This prospective randomized study will test the response to the treatment. The investigators shall measure cellular degradation products due to the OS, thereby certifying that it does have a deleterious effect on sperm cell. Seminal biochemistry will also assess the impact of the syndrome on the genital tract glands and follow its evolution.

The patients will be included in the study as soon as the leukocytospermia will be \> 0,5\*106/ml or as soon as the elastase will be \> 500 ng/mL.

The examinations will be performed using flow cytometry, CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analysis). The analysis of sperm morphology will be centralized.

Primary endpoint will be a reduction in the percentage of 8OH-dG below 35 %. We anticipate that it should arrive to 20 % of the patients included in the arm treatment by corticosteroid therapy. All in all will thus be needed 50 patients in the group placebo and 50 in the group treated.

NCT06217822,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

mCRPC is a cancer of the prostate (male reproductive gland found below the bladder) that has spread to other parts of the body. This type of prostate cancer does not respond to hormone treatment used to lower the level of testosterone, a male sex hormone, to prevent cancer from growing.

The study treatment 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium, also called BAY3563254, is under development to treat advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It works by binding to PSMA and giving off radiation that can damage cancer cells and stop them from growing.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:

* How safe is BAY3563254 in participants.
* What is the recommended dose of BAY3563254 that is safe and works well that will be further tested in Part 2 of the study.
* How well does BAY3563254 work in participants.

To answer this, the researchers will look at:

* The number and severity of medical problems including serious medical problems that participants experience after taking BAY3563254
* The number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dose level. A DLT is a medical problem caused by a drug that is too severe to continue the use of that specific dose.
* The number of participants whose cancer completely disappears (complete response) or reduces by at least 30% (partial response) after taking the treatment (also known as objective response rate (ORR))
* The number of participants who have a decrease in the levels of PSA\* by at least 50% in their blood (also known as PSA50). PSA is a protein made by the prostate gland. High levels of PSA may indicate the presence of prostate cancer.
* Participants' best response to treatment based on their PSA levels (also known as the best overall PSA response).

The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 for use in the second part of the study. For this, each participant will receive one of different increasing amounts of BAY3563254. They will take BAY3563254 as an injection into a vein. All participants in the second part of the study, called dose expansion, will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 that was identified from the first part of the study.

Participants in this study will take the study treatment once every 6 weeks, which is known as a treatment cycle. Each participant will have up to 4 of these treatment cycles, if the participant benefits from the treatment. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 6 years, including a screening phase of up to 30 days, 6 months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase of 60 months after the end of treatment.

In addition, substudies performed during both dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study will evaluate:

* the clearance of radioactivity from the body over time
* the doses of radiation that are delivered to normal organs and tumors
* the ability of an experimental agent (Tris-POC) to decrease the amount of radiation absorbed by normal organs.

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature
* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)
* take tumor samples if required
* check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and bone scan
* check the tumor status using PET (positron emission tomography)
* check the amount of radiation absorbed by tumors and normal organs using SPECT/CT (single-photon emission tomography and computed tomography scan)
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.

The treatment period ends with a visit in 6-12 weeks after the last BAY3563254 dose. About 6-12 weeks after the last dose and every 6 weeks thereafter, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and any changes in their cancer. This active follow-up period ends after 18 months. The long-term follow-up period will start after the end of the active follow-up visit and will continue for up to 60 months after the the last BAY3563254 dose.

NCT05263297,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of two different cognitive-behavioral combined programs, including video games or kaleidoscope, on the pain, fear and anxiety experienced by children who apply for therapeutic or diagnostic venous blood collection, and their parents' satisfaction levels. In addition, this research aims to create a holistic approach to child health due to the evaluation of both children and parents.

The population of the research will be children aged 8-10 who come to the Children's Blood Collection Unit of Karaman Training and Research Hospital between February 2022 and March 2022. The sample of the study will consist of 96 children and their parents who applied to the Blood Collection Unit on the specified dates, met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study.

NCT00059475,"This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma. The likelihood of melanoma returning is higher in patients who have melanoma lesions deep in the skin, in patients who have had positive lymph nodes, and in patients who have had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that has spread beyond the primary site). Melanoma tumors produce proteins called glycoprotein 100 (gp100) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1). Vaccination with specific pieces of these proteins (peptides) may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide.

Patients 16 years of age and older whose melanoma has been surgically removed and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG), x-rays and other imaging studies will be done if recent results are not available. Some candidates may require heart tests, such as a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram, or lung function tests. In addition, all candidates will be tested for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type; patients must be type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)\*0201, the type on which this vaccine is based.

Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different vaccines to determine which peptides offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of two injections of the vaccines every 3 weeks for four times. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (every 6 months), patients will undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the melanoma does not return. The injections are given at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects.

Patients will be followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates out the lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Some patients may undergo a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the effects of the vaccines on the tumor immune cells.

Patients whose disease returns during the first course of vaccine therapy will have surgery to remove the tumor and will continue to receive the vaccine treatment. Patients whose tumor returns after completing one course of therapy may receive a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which can boost immune function against the tumor. interleukin-2 (IL-2) is given intravenously (through a small tube placed in a vein) every 8 hours for 4 days. This regimen is repeated after 10 to 14 days. Those who respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) will have a third course of treatment after 2 months. Patients whose disease recurs after treatment will be taken off the study and will be referred back to their referring physician or to another study, if an appropriate one is available.","['experimental vaccine', 'Montanide ISA-51', 'peptides', 'interleukin-2 (IL-2)']","['', '', '', '']"

Findings from this project will help the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER) Office of Generic Drugs improve policy development and review practice in the future for similar products, e.g. extended release oral drug products being metabolized in the gut wall and having multiple strengths.

Aim 1: To compare the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites in plasma in healthy individuals when they ingest different strengths of bupropion (75-300 mg) with variable release profiles (IR vs XL vs SR) in GI tract.

Working hypothesis: Variation in release rate and mechanism of bupropion formulations in gastrointestinal (GI) tract will impact metabolism and saturation of bupropion in GI tract, which will generate different concentration of bupropion and its metabolites in plasma.

Aim 2: To investigate pharmacogenomics of CYP 2B6 that influences metabolism, saturation, and pharmacokinetics of bupropion

Working hypothesis: The gain of function of CYP2B6 variants (allele \*4 and \*22) in patients will increase the metabolism of bupropion in the GI tract and liver, reduce both local concentration and plasma concentration of bupropion, and thus cause non-bioequivalence when bupropion is released earlier in GI tract","['bupropion', 'Bupropion HCl']","['bupropion', 'bupropion']"

In France, their incidence is estimated to 100 cases per year (data from the ""Base de données Hospitalière Française sur l'Infection à VIH"" (FHDH)). The main mechanisms involved in lymphomagenesis are immune dysfunction, involvement of oncogenic viruses (Epstein-Barr (EBV) and HHV8) and molecular oncogenic events. A better understanding of these different pathways, give the possibility to design specific treatments. The treatment of these lymphomas is not standardized. A prospective study of patients with HIV associated lymphoid malignancies is an innovating tool to answer epidemiological, physiopathological and therapeutic questions. We propose a prospective multicentric study of these patients.

The main objectives of this prospective study are to:

* evaluate the incidence, characterise clinically and histologically NHL and HL cases associated to HIV
* perform an observational study of the treatment and outcome of these patients out of the context of clinical trials,
* study the differentiation and activation of B-cell populations,
* better understand the role of specific T cell responses in the control of EBV infection,
* allow other biological studies from the ANRS group "" Lymphome et VIH "".

The recruitment of 40 cases per year is expected. The length of inclusions is 7 years. The follow-up will be of 2 years. Clinical, pathological and biological data at diagnosis and during follow-up will be collected. This will allow characterizing the lymphoma, the HIV infection, the antitumoral treatments and the outcome of lymphoma. Biological samples will be centralized to collect cell, DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and tumour collections (Y.Taoufik, S Prevot\* ). To better understand the EBV infection and lymphomagenesis in HIV infection, we propose to follow the viral load and the molecular characteristics of EBV in PBMC, plasma and tumour (P.Morand\* , V.Boyer\* ), to investigate the EBV-T cell responses (G.Carcelain) and the presence and reactivation of EBV in peripheral B cells (C.Amiel\* , JC Nicolas) and in tumoral samples (M.Raphael\* , I.Joab\* ). The other mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in HIV infection will be studied by the analysis of the sub-populations of B-cells in terms of activation and differentiation (Y.Taoufik) and by the characterization of MSI tumours (A.Duval).","['EBV', 'HHV8']","['', '']"

NCT04125069,"Cardiac Surgery and Acute Kidney Failure (AKI) post Surgery:

AKI is a frequent complication in the immediate aftermath of cardiac surgery with an incidence varying from 5 to 40%. KDIGO criteria (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) are used to define the AKI in cardiac surgery because of their validated prognostic value in this patient population. The occurrence of a postoperative AKI, even of low severity, is accompanied by a significant increase in the duration of hospitalization and mortality. The AKI risk factors in cardiac surgery are related to the precarious clinical conditions of the patient before the surgery, to the complex surgical context, to the surgical procedures particularly the duration of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) greater than 120 min and the occurrence of a postoperative circulatory insufficiency.

AKI and inflammatory response:

The mechanisms involved in postoperative AKI in cardiac surgery, are low cardiac output, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), mechanical intravascular hemolysis, hypothermia, and activation of the neuroendocrine system by the ECC.

In addition, ECC triggers a secondary inflammatory response to blood contact with the ECC circuit and membranes. The secondary stimulation of immunocompetent cells accompanies secretion of many cytokines and proinflammatory mediators via the activation of nuclear transcription factors as the NFκB factor.

Of the 50 000 ECC performed per year in France, about 25% of the patients develop a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Although most often transient, SIRS can intensify and lead to a multi-visceral failure and to death, especially if the patient presents medical history of type 2 diabete. Increase of postoperative plasma cytokine levels has a positive predictive value on the occurrence of AKI and the risk of death.

Priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome and post ECC inflammatory response:

In addition to activation by nuclear transcription factors (NFκB), the inflammatory syndrome may develop secondarily to the activation of multi-protein platforms, called inflammasomes.

The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been particularly studied in humans because of its association with multiple chronic inflammatory pathologies, infectious and cardio-metabolic diseases. Its activation is the combination of intracellular receptors like NOD-like receptors (NLR) types, ASC-like adapter proteins and pro caspase-1.

This assembly activates inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, in particular) responsible for the cleavage of pro-interleukins IL-1β and IL-18 in mature pro-inflammatory cytokines that participate in the orchestration of the inflammatory response.

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires prior priming which allows increase of NLRP3 and pro-cytokines IL1β and IL18 expressions. This priming is particularly intense in the presence of a mitochondrial dysfunction and of an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Next, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may be secondary to the presence of danger signals from cellular damages, such as cellular and mitochondrial debris (including mitochondrial DNA) recognized by NLRP3 receptors. Thus, preoperative mitochondrial dysfunction and its postoperative aggravation by ECC due to IRI induced by ECC represents powerful signals ,of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Research hypothesis:

The hypothesis is that the preoperative priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome by a preoperative mitochondrial dysfunction is a factor favoring the occurrence of postoperative AKI after cardiac surgery with ECC.

For type 2 diabetic patients, the investigators think that preoperative mitochondrial dysfunction (mitochondrial respiration abnormalities and hyperpermeability of mitochondrial membranes) is accentuated worsening IRI induced by the ECC.

This increases postoperative release of cells and mitochondrial debris that maintain the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, exacerbating the inflammatory response and favoring the occurrence of AKI.","['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'Lipitor']","['ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '']"
NCT00675038,"Many hematological disorders are treated by giving red blood cells. Over a long period of time iron from the red blood cell will accumulate in the tissues of the heart, liver, and endocrine glands. This condition is referred to as iron overload and may become life threatening due to the effects of the iron on these tissues. The normal method for evaluation of iron overload is a liver biopsy. This procedure is invasive and has potential risks, such as bleeding and infection.

It is very desirable to establish a method for assessing iron overload which is not invasive. New magnet resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation techniques (T2\*MRI) can be used to indirectly assess the liver iron content and iron in the heart. Results of T2\*MRIs show excellent correlation with liver iron content and heart function. The use of this method of assessment will minimize the risk and inconvenience of liver biopsy and possibly allow more frequent evaluations for iron overload, thus better treatment for these patients.

Participants in this study will undergo both liver biopsy for liver iron content and T2\* MRI of the liver and the heart. Results from the procedures performed in this study will be compared, with the end result being the possible elimination of invasive procedures to diagnose iron overload.",['iron'],['iron']

NCT03503994,"While many short-term morbidities associated with extreme prematurity have declined over the last two decades, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has increased to a rate of approximately 45% in neonates \<28 weeks gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) \<1,500 g. Neonates with BPD are at increased risk for adverse short-and long-term neurodevelopmental and respiratory outcomes that often persist into adulthood.

There is a growing body of pathological and biochemical evidence that implicates inflammation in its pathogenesis. This is further supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrate the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in facilitating extubation and reducing BPD. However, several short- and long-term adverse effects associated with the use of systemic corticosteroids have been described, the most concerning of which is their effect on neurodevelopment, specifically an increased rate of cerebral palsy (CP).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are an attractive alternative to systemic steroids because of these concerns. Earlier systematic reviews had not found any benefit in using ICS for the prevention or treatment of BPD. However, a recent systematic review showed a significant reduction in death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected GA (CGA) (risk ratio=0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.75, 0.99), BPD (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.65, 0.91), and use of systemic steroids (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.76, 0.98) in infants treated with ICS.

Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of ICS for BPD, uncertainty remains over treatment timing, effective dose, and long-term effects. There is also variation in the delivery systems used for delivery of ICS. These concerns continue to be echoed in a recent review by Nelin et al. Given that the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of ICS were unknown at the time of this study and many infants are able to wean from ventilation without steroids, the investigators conducted an escalating-dose ranging study of late ICS (i.e. administered after the first week of life) delivered by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) utilizing a specially designed valved delivery system to determine the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve extubation or reduction in oxygen requirements and the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of increasing doses of ICS.","['corticosteroids', 'systemic corticosteroids', 'inhaled corticosteroids', 'ICS']","['', '', '', '']"

* Do people with HIV who fail to achieve viral suppression contribute to the ongoing spread of HIV in Ethiopia, or does HIV transmission mainly occur between persons with no exposure to such therapy?
* Are viruses with drug-resistance mutations transmitted onwards from people with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy who fail to achieve viral suppression? \* Which factors are involved in treatment failure and emergence of drug-resistant viruses longitudinally?

Participants will be enrolled with regard to history of antiretroviral therapy exposure (newly diagnosed/treatment-naïve vs. treatment-experienced with lack of viral suppression), using persons on antiretroviral therapy with viral suppression for control. We will compare the following outcomes between these groups:

NCT05577988,"Patients who suffered from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are usually treated with a long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to reduce stent thrombosis and recurrent ischemic event. Nonetheless, recent important data have demonstrated the efficacy of a short term DAPT and an early single antiplatelet therapy in high bleeding and ischemic risk patients.

The bleeding risk is associated with a significant mortality. This risk is especially high in patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitors like ticagrelor or prasugrel after an ACS.

As a result of the abounding data regarding the safety of an early single antiplatelet therapy with high potency antiplatelet therapy (ticagrelor or prasugrel), it is likely that such strategy will soon be implemented in the guidelines.

The benefits of these high-potency P2Y12 inhibitors over clopidogrel mostly occur in patients with genetic polymorphisms of CYP2Y12 associated with a loss of function in clopidogrel metabolism.

Furthermore, the anti-ischemic benefit of potent P2Y12 inhibitors over clopidogrel occurs early, while excess bleeding events often arise during chronic treatment.

Our hypothesis is that a systematic and rapid genetic screening of CYP2C90 \*2 or \*17 polymorphism to guide an early single therapy with low potency antiplatelet (aspirin or clopidogrel) could lead to less bleeding events with a consistent efficacy towards cardiac events compared with high potency antiplatelet therapies (prasugrel or ticagrelor) in high bleeding risk patients treated for ACS.","['ticagrelor', 'prasugrel', 'clopidogrel', 'aspirin']","['ticagrelor', 'prasugrel', 'clopidogrel', 'acetylsalicylic acid']"

NCT05428267,"The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) is about 10% in the general population, but increases with age, ranging from 9.1% in men 40-49 years to 55% in men \>70. The major risk factors for ED are as follows: diabetes; heart conditions; tobacco use; obesity; injuries to the nerves that control erection; medications such as antidepressants; psychological conditions such as stress, anxiety, or depression; and drug or alcohol use (4). The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF5) is a simple and well-validated tool for the evaluation of ED (5) and is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of symptom severity. The link between cirrhosis and ED has been suggested in a recent study, showing ED was also impacted by liver failure, portal hypertension and other known risk factors. In the investigators team, they showed, additionally, that neurocognitive impairment is associated with ED in cirrhosis (data not published). The prevalence of ED after liver transplantation (LT) varies among series, ranging from 66 to 86%.

After LT, on the one hand, improvement of liver function and bioavailable testosterone favours the improvement of ED. On the other hand, immunosuppressive agents are suspected to worsen it.

ED's reversibility has also been discussed; nevertheless, data are scarce and heterogeneous.

In the investigators group, they can perform in routine a neurocognitive evaluation of patients with cirrhosis thanks to a neuropsychologist experienced in cognitive disorders occurring in patients with cirrhosis.

NCT01152905,"Background: Recent studies have questioned our previous understanding on the effect of nitrous oxide on muscle relaxants, since nitrous oxide has been shown to potentiate the action of bolus doses of mivacurium, rocuronium and vecuronium. This study was aimed to investigate the possible effect of nitrous oxide on the infusion requirements of cisatracurium.

Methods: 70 ASA physical status I-III patients aged 18-75 years were enrolled in this randomized trial. The patients were undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with a duration of at least 90 minutes. Patients were randomized to receive propofol and remifentanil by target controlled infusion in combination with either a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Nitrous oxide/TIVA group) or oxygen in air (Air/TIVA group). A 0.1 mg/kg initial bolus of cisatracurium was administered before tracheal intubation, followed by a closed-loop computer controlled infusion of cisatracurium to produce and maintain a 90% neuromuscular block. Cumulative dose requirements of cisatracurium during the 90-min study period after bolus administration were measured and the asymptotic steady state rate of infusion to produce a constant 90% block was determined by applying nonlinear curve fitting to the data on the cumulative dose requirement during the study period.

Results: Controller performance, i.e. the ability of the controller to maintain neuromuscular block constant at the setpoint and patient characteristics were similar in both groups. The administration of nitrous oxide did not affect cisatracurium infusion requirements.

NCT00211770,"Autism, originally described by Kanner (1943), is among the most severe of neuropsychiatric disorders. It is a pervasive developmental disorder affecting social, communicative, and compulsive/repetitive behaviors characterized by stereotypic complex hand and body movements, craving for sameness, and narrow repetitive interests. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characteristically heterogeneous and show marked variability in their response to interventions. Studies of behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions document approximately 1/3 of ASD participants fail to respond to targeted treatments. Efforts to evaluate the specificity of treatment effects are important to inform conceptualizations about the disorder, identify behavioral phenotypes, and to aide clinical decision making.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of clinical behavioral pharmacology methods, functional behavioral assessments (FBA), in assessing the treatment effects of pediatric medications in children with ASD. The present study of FBA procedures in pharmacological treatment will be conducted as a separate, but parallel study within IRB approved, federally funded, double-masked, placebo controlled medication trials of citalopram (GCO # 01-1295 PS\*), an SSRI hypothesized to reduce stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in ASD and divalproex sodium (GCO # 01-0294), a medication recently found to reduce repetitive behaviors in ASD (Hollander et al., in press). This study will focus on the use of FBAs in distinguishing responders vs. nonresponders on the basis of behavior function, in evaluating functional patterns for stereotypy, aggression, and impulsivity, and in using descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in clinical trials.

FBAs are behavioral assessment methods used to hypothesize about the function of maladaptive behaviors. FBAs are conducted either through experimental manipulations known as functional analyses or through descriptive analyses procedures, which involve structured observations and parent/caregiver interviews. Descriptive analyses will be conducted with all participants (n=24). The more rigorous, functional analyses will be conducted with a sub-set of the sample (n=6) to corroborate the findings of the descriptive analyses. Data from the FBAs will be collected using videotaped recordings of behavior and coded by trained raters for both the descriptive and experimental analyses.

Our pilot data and other published data suggest that certain medications such as citalopram (celexa) and divalproex sodium (Depakote) may improve global functioning in autistic patients and repetitive/compulsive behaviors and social deficits.

NCT00394212,"It is estimated that up to 20% of patients who have Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery will not meet their weight loss goal, or may even regain some of the weight they initially lost. One possible explanation is that the opening between the stomach pouch and the intestine becomes stretched. If this opening becomes too wide, food may be able to pass from the stomach to the intestine too quickly - causing patients to feel less full after eating.

For some patients, doctors may recommend additional invasive surgery to tighten the opening between the stomach pouch and the small intestine. Although this may help patients resume their weight loss, the risk of complications during a second surgical procedure is significantly higher than the risk during the original gastric bypass.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate an incisionless procedure for patients who have either had inadequate weight loss or have regained weight following gastric bypass. The procedure is designed to tighten the opening between the stomach pouch and the small intestine, which may slow down the passage of food to help patients feel full longer after eating.",['Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass'],['']
NCT04283565,"Cardiovascular pathologies (CV), the second leading cause of death just behind tumors, are particularly frequent in France and strongly mobilize the resources of the healthcare system (ambulatory and health facility). The French High Authority for Health (HAS) has defined major cardio-vascular risk factors (CVRF): smoking, high blood pressure (hypertension), elevated total cholesterol (TC) or LDL, decreased HDL cholesterol, type II diabetes and age, and predisposing CVRF or discussed: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, menopause, elevation of triglycerides and genetic factors.

Lower-linb peripherial arterial disease (AOMI), even if asymptomatic, involves systemic atherial disease, responsible for mortality irrespective of the presence of CVRF. The prevalence of asymptomatic AOMI is 10 to 20% beyond 55 years old, and the associated mortality is 18 to 30% at 5 years.

Individual screening is achievable by well-conducted clinical evaluation and systematic measurement of the simple, non-invasive Blood Pressure Index (BPI) in all subjects at risk. A BPI\<0.9 indicates an event risk close to that of the symptomatic patient. However, if this strategy is recommended by the HAS, it is not carried out systematically in current practice. Therapeutic means available for the management of an asymptomatic AOMI are the identification and support for controllable CVRF such as smoking and nutrition (diet and physical activity) in the context of secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. Thus, the generalization of a systematique screening strategy of AOMI, allowing faster handling of CVRF by advices and Motivational Interviewing (MI), could have a significant impact, both clinically and economically.

Patients could also benefit from this support in terms of quality of life both on the physiological dimension (effect of weight loss, correction of disorders of cardiac function, etc.), that on the psychic dimension (well-being of patients, management of disorders anxious). However, few studies have evaluated the benefit of such a strategy in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs),none did it on a cost recovery basis. No such studies have been conducted in France.

The feasibility of this project is based on the success of a pilot study conducted in Centre-Val de Loire region (France) in 2013. It showed that the implementation of a strategy of systematic screening of the asymptomatic AOMI based on the measurement of the BPI in high cardiovascular risk patients is feasible in current practice by general practitioners, and could be more efficient than interventions performed in current practice.","['smoking cessation drugs', 'nutritional supplements', 'pharmacotherapy']","['', '', '']"

Patients ≥ 50 years with small, low-risk breast cancer who are operated but not irradiated show local relapse rates around 6% after 5 years. With adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) the local relapse rate drops to under 1% after 5 years under Tamoxifen (4).

It has been demonstrated (6, 9, 10) that the efficacy of radiation of the tumor bed only in a selected group can be non-inferior to WBRT.

The TARGIT C study should confirm the efficacy of a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in a well selected group of patients with small breast cancer and absence of risk factors. In presence of risk factors postoperative WBRT will be added to complete the radiotherapeutic treatment according to international guidelines.

Endpoints are the local relapse rate (within 2 cm of the tumor bed), ipsilateral relapse, cancer-specific and overall survival and contralateral breast cancer as well as documentation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome.

The expected local relapse rates are 0.825/1.375% after 3/5 years, respectively. Discontinuation of the trial is scheduled if rates of local relapse rates rise to 1.55/2.4/4% after 1/3/5 years.

Instead of using normal light in contact meibography, non-contact meibography utilises infra-red (IR) light. IR light is shined on patients' inverted eyelids and a special camera then allows visualisation of the structure of the meibomian glands, including the ducts and acini. Currently, images taken via non-contact meibography are manually analysed by a skilled clinician.

Knowledge of the health of meibomian glands is useful, especially in the diagnosis of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Studies have shown that MGD is one of the most common causes of evaporative dry eye.

NCT03346980,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that predisposes to a number or malignant disorders \[1,2\]. Clinically, FAP presents with an abnormal number of colorectal polyps (100-5000), while it genetically is defined by mutations in the APC-gene \[1\]. Historically, colorectal cancer has been the major cause of deaths for FAP patient. However, as the incidence of colorectal cancer has decreased with the use of prophylactic colectomy, the incidence of duodenal cancer has increased \[3,4\]. It is estimated that the cumulative lifetime risk of duodenal polyposis exceeds 95% \[1,5\]. The predictor of duodenal cancer is duodenal polyposis, which is almost inevitable in patients with FAP.

In 1989 the Spigelman score was introduced in order to assess the severity of duodenal polyposis and stratify patients according to risk of duodenal cancer (Table 1) \[6\]. It is a composite score that includes two endoscopic parameters (number and maximum size of polyps, respectively) and two histopathological parameters (histological subtype and grade of dysplasia). The score ranges from 0-12 and it has been classified in four stages. The 10-year risk of developing duodenal cancer corresponds with the Spigelman stage ranging from ≈0 for stage 0-1 to 36% for stage 4 \[7\]. Besides duodenal cancer, the indications of cancer prophylactic surgical resection are debatable, but generally recommended in the case of Spigelman stage 4 or high-grade dysplasia.

NCT04993872,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a critical comorbidity for patients living with HIV (PLWH), with an estimated prevalence between 2.4 and 17%, leading to end-stage renal disease 3 to 6 fold more than non-HIV population. However kidney transplantation for PLWH has become the first-line therapy for end-stage renal disease, with an enhanced survival benefit compared to remaining on dialysis.

Management of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients (HIV-KTR) has historically been problematic because of the potential nephrotoxicity of some antiretroviral drugs and the interactions between calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and ritonavir or cobicistat-boosted containing-ART. The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a widely recommended nucleotide analogue for the treatment of both HIV and HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection, is restricted in vulnerable kidney population as HIV-KTR due to its major potential toxicity consistent with tubular dysfunction and rarely with a progressive sustained decline in renal function. The optimal long-term ART regimen is not known in HIV-KTR, though it makes intuitive sense to avoid regimens containing TDF, given its potential nephrotoxicity. Nevertheless the potent virological efficacy of TDF both on HIV and HBV and its highest in-vitro barrier to resistance among the Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors makes tenofovir use highly recommended or even essential in HIV/HBV co-infections.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and bictegravir (BIC) are 2 novel antiretroviral drug available in HIV treatment in combination with emtricitabine (F) (B/F/TAF):

\* TAF is a novel prodrug of tenofovir that may offer improved renal safety over TDF. TAF is more stable in plasma and is metabolized intracellularly by cathepsin A, an enzyme that is highly expressed in lymphoid tissues. Therefore, TAF can achieve higher intracellular levels of the active moiety tenofovir diphosphate, with lower levels of circulating tenofovir when compared with TDF. This more targeted treatment could potentially result in fewer renal and bone complications despite the same clinical efficacy as TDF. TAF was approved for use in PLWH with mild-moderate CKD (eGFR: 30-69 mL/min).

The availability of TAF seems a potential addition to the antiretroviral armamentarium in HIV-KTR. \* BIC is a novel second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) has a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and in-vitro activity against most INSTI-resistant variants and has low potential for clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions. BIC has been recently approved by the FDA, in coformulated B/F/TAF for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral naïve subjects and in those with suppressed viremia.

No data are available yet with TAF use in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients as well as with BIC, especially about potential drug-to-drug interactions with immunosuppressive drugs such as calcineurin \& mTOR inhibitors.

At last simplification to a single tablet regimen (STR) may offer a once-daily option for HIV-KTR who have multiple comorbidities, often requires complex regimens with a high pill burden.","['Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)', 'Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)', 'Emtricitabine (F)', 'Bictegravir (BIC)', 'Tenofovir diphosphate']","['', '', '', '', '']"

NCT04831593,"Background and Aim:

Pulmonary aspiration of gastric content in the perioperative period is rare, but it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality that anesthetists never want to encounter. Due to reasons such as emergency surgical procedures, communication problems with pediatric patients or their parents, impaired cognitive function, obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver and kidney diseases, it is observed that there is sometimes inconsistency between the periods defined in the preoperative fasting guidelines in pediatric patients and the state of gastric content and volume encountered in clinical practice. There is a lack of data on children on this issue. In this study, primary we aimed to evaluate the incidence of empty and full stomach in pediatric patients who underwent elective and emergency surgery in our routine anesthesia practice. Also we want to determine the relationship between fasting time and qualitative assessment of gastric content. Secondary this study sought to examine whether correlation between gastric ultrasound finding and fasting time, and also to determine relationship with the current comorbidities.

Design:

This is a prospective, single blinded, observational study. The minimum sample size required to determine the prevalence of full stomach, 0.05, within the limits of ± 0.025 with 0.95 confidence, was calculated as 292.

When calculating with the proposed equation of n = 100 + 50i to determine the factors affecting by logistic regression (here i is the number of variables in the model), the minimum number of samples required for logistic regression analysis was calculated as 300 in case of 4 independent variables in the model. n=100+50\*4= 300

Methods:

Pediatric patients younger than 18 yr old who are to undergo elective and emergency surgery under general anaesthesia at our hospital are enrolled in this prospective observational study between April and December 2021. Preoperative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum are performed by one anesthesiologist who has been instructed and supervised by an experienced pediatric radiologist and who is blind to the patient's history. Ultrasonographic measurement of the gastric antral cross-sectional area (CSA) are performed in supine position and right lateral decubitus position (RLD). The gastric antrum is imaged in a sagittal plane, between the left lobe of the liver and the pancreas, at the level of the aorta, as previously described \[1\]. This examination allowed qualitative assessment of gastric contents according to the three-point grading scale previously described by Perlas and colleagues\[2\]. Grade 0 was defined by the absence of appearance of any content in a flat antrum in both the supine and the RLD positions. Grade 1 was defined by the appearance of any gastric content in the RLD position only, and Grade 2 was defined by the appearance of any content in both the RLD and the supine positions. The antral cross-sectional area is also calculated in both position, by measuring the longitudinal diameter (D1) and the anteroposterior diameter (D2) of the antrum, from serosa to serosa using this formula \[3\] Antral area= (π x D1 X D2) / 4.

NCT02108808,"Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established invasive method for assessing the physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis. Adenosine, an important endogenous regulator of coronary blood flow during both stress and ischemia, is widely used to achieve conditions of stable hyperemia required for measurement of FFR.

Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving ticagrelor revealed a differential coronary blood flow velocity response during increasing doses of adenosine compared to placebo or prasugrel treated subjects, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that patients treated with ticagrelor have increased plasma adenosine levels. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the degree of hyperemia obtained with adenosine infusion may be greater in patients on ticagrelor than that obtained in patients taking clopidogrel or prasugrel. If this proves to be true, it would lead to a lower FFR value with possible important clinical implications in ticagrelor receiving patients in need for FFR measurement.

Platelet reactivity measured by aggregometry predicts major cardiovascular events in ACS patients treated with clopidogrel. Due to their frequent prescription, generic clopidogrel efficacy must be evaluated. The purpose of this study is to compare the platelet reactivity in patients with ACS receiving clopidogrel generic versus patent.","['aspirin', 'clopidogrel']","['acetylsalicylic acid', 'clopidogrel']"

NCT04099849,"It is well documented that zinc supplementation to low-income population results in the reduced incidence of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia, and improves growth of stunted children. In Bangladesh, the risk of zinc deficiency is considered to be high and children could benefit greatly by improving their zinc intakes on a daily basis. Zinc supplementation at a national scale would be a formidable task. There is a need to find an alternative. It might be sustainable to improve intake of zinc through fortified staples, e.g. rice with increased amounts of zinc; in fact such biofortified rice has been developed through conventional breeding, which is designed to contain an amount of zinc that could meet at least 40% of the daily requirement.

In the first round of the previously approved and completed studies, total absorbed zinc (TAZ) did not differ when diets containing zinc biofortified rice (ZnBfR) or conventional rice (CR) were compared. Thus, the current study is planned to repeat using a new variety of (ZnBfR) that is expected to have higher zinc content than the variety previously studied. Initially, a pilot study will be conducted in 4 participants using a modified isotope administration protocol such that the oral tracers will be given on two days each at half the original dose each day so as to provide a lower proportion of the total daily zinc intake as tracer solution.

Hypotheses:

1. Young children will have greater total absorbed zinc (TAZ) when they consume mixed diets containing ZnBfR than when they consume the same diets containing CR.
2. TAZ will not differ in children who receive the ZnBfR-containing diet or the same diet containing CR plus sufficient additional zinc to match the zinc content of the ZnBfR diet.

Objectives:

1. To measure the amount of zinc absorbed from ZnBfR compared with the amount absorbed from CR and from CR fortified with added zinc, using the triple stable isotope tracer ratio technique in young children.
2. To assess the intestinal function of the children, using a sugar permeability test (lactulose:mannitol test).
3. (Pilot study) To verify that the modified tracer dose will provide adequate signal for assessing zinc absorption.

Methods:

To assess the potentials for biofortified rice in providing a good, bioavailable source of additional zinc, it is proposed here to measure zinc absorption from rice-based meals among Bangladeshi preschool children. The amount of zinc absorbed from ZnBfR compared to that absorbed from a conventional Bangladeshi rice (Diet-CR) (control) will be measured. Zinc absorbed from ZnBfR with that from zinc-fortified conventional rice (Diet-CR+Z) will also be compared. The study will be a cross-over, randomized, controlled clinical study. Initially, a pilot study will be conducted with a modified dose of zinc stable isotope among 4 children aged 36-59 months of either sex from a peri-urban community in Dhaka. Later on, 44 children aged 36-59 months of either sex will be recruited from the same community as mentioned before, and they will be individually randomized, in equal numbers, to one of the two comparison groups, A and B. During an initial one-day acclimatization period, the study children will receive the conventional rice based diet three times a day, to confirm that they will accept the study diets and adhere to the study procedures. On study days 2 and 4, in comparison group A, the study subjects will receive either the Diet-ZnBfR or Diet-CR based on the random assignments, and they will receive Diet-CR or Diet ZnBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2 and 4), Likewise, in comparison group B, the study subjects will receive either Diet-ZnBfR or Diet-CR+Z on days 2 and 4 based on the random assignments, and they will receive Diet-CR+Z or the Diet-ZnBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2 and 4). Zinc stable isotope tracer techniques will be used to measure the fractional absorption of zinc, in which tracer : tracee ratios will be measured in spot urine samples following administration of an intravenously administered tracer (68Zn) and one of two oral tracers (70Zn, 67Zn) provided with test meals over a four-day period.

Outcome measures/variables: Intake of total dietary zinc (TDZ) and phytate for each subject will be calculated during the clinical study. Fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) will be determined from the isotopic ratios obtained in urine samples using the following equation, which shows, as an example, the calculation that will be used for zinc absorption from the diet traced with 67Zn:

FAZ = 67Zn tracer:tracee ratio / 68Zn tracer:tracee ratio \* (68Zn dose given IV / 67Zn dose given orally)

Total absorbed zinc (TAZ) for each child will be calculated as follows:

NCT05588011,"Open-heart surgery requires temporarily stopping the heart and lungs and diverting the patient's blood to an outside system that takes over the function of the heart and lungs. This is possible through the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) which diverts blood, through plastic tubing, to a heart-lung machine which includes an oxygenator. The external oxygenator works as an artificial lung. This allows cardiac surgeons to operate in a field that is free of blood, while the patient's body continues to receive healthy blood.

CPB is an advanced medical technology that allows for heart surgeries, such as coronary artery bypass, heart valve surgery, and procedures involving major blood vessels. It is recognized that there are many risks associated with its use, including microscopic stress exerted on blood components by the oxygenator and tubing, which can lead to irreversible damage to the blood cells. This effect can contribute to bleeding during and after surgery. This type of bleeding can be difficult to monitor and treat, especially given the limited access to point-of-care blood testing to inform clinicians on what part of the blood is failing to function properly.

The investigators will use a point-of-care machine called Plateletworks to test the function of platelets during surgeries which require CPB. Platelets are an important part of blood that help stop bleeding by forming clots. At the investigators' institution two oxygenators are currently used interchangeably. These oxygenators have different properties that may impact how platelets function. This project will help determine if using a higher pressure oxygenator increases the risk of patients bleeding. Additionally, the investigators will compare the platelet data from Plateletworks to data collected from rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). This will yield valuable data about commonly used oxygenators and tests which can ultimately improve patient care.","['Plateletworks', 'ROTEM']","['', '']"

NCT06041555,"The MRI linac Unity is a major technological evolution in radiotherapy combining a linear accelerator with a 1.5T MRI (radiological quality). It allows to target the target volume more precisely and to adapt the daily dose distribution according to variations in the position and volume of the tumor, critical organs and the tumor response. In many studies conducted in radiology, the analysis of specific MRI sequences, particularly in radiomics, aims to characterize tumors and their sensitivity to treatment. Initial data show that in radiotherapy, it would eventually be possible to characterize the radiosensitivity of healthy and tumorous tissues. With linac 1.5T MRI, the performance of selected MRI sequences, at each session, could make it possible to identify different levels of radiosensitivity within the tumour. The reproduction of these sequences on a daily basis could make it possible to follow the variations in radiosensitivity during the treatment. The final objectives would be: 1- to adapt the doses of radiotherapy to each session with a modulation of the dose according to the daily level of intra-tumor radiosensitivity, 2- to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools allowing an analysis sequences and the generation of 3D maps of intra-tumor radiosensitivity, fast and suitable for carrying out a radiotherapy session.

A first work carried out in collaboration with the CREATIS lab of the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1) made it possible to generate maps of tissue oxygenation from sequences produced on the MRI linac Unity of the Hospices Civils de Lyon (T2\* , IVIM, Carto T2 Multi Echo-Gradient). Hypoxia is known to be the first factor of tumor resistance to irradiation. A research program is structured in collaboration with UCBL1 in order to develop radiobiological adaptive radiotherapy approaches, based on 3D maps of intra-tumoral hypoxia and their variation during treatment. Several tumor locations were selected because of the preponderant place of MRI in tumor characterization: prostate, cervix, kidney, ENT and glioblastoma. Hypoxia is not the only factor of radioresistance. Changes in the microenvironment could also impact the sensitivity of tumor cells. The program will therefore also aim to optimize the maps initially based on hypoxia, by identifying other relevant factors to be taken into account to define intra-tumor sensitivity.","['MRI linac Unity', 'ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'radiomics', 'Lipitor', 'T2\tradiological qualityIVIM', 'Carto T2 Multi Echo-Gradient']","['', 'ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '', '', '', '']"

NCT04088942,"Background:

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and it contributes to the development of many other serious diseases. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) often lead to hospitalization. Severe hospitalization-requiring AECOPD carries very high economic costs for the healthcare system, and personal costs for patients. Smoking cessation in COPD for the healthcare system, and personal costs for patients. Smoking cessation in COPD patients is known to improve survival and reduce the number of AECOPD. However, smoking cessation interventions in these patients have only been successful for consistent smoking abstinence in 12 months in approximately 15-20%. Thus, more effective interventions are needed for this patient group.

Aims:

The aim of this study is to determine, among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whether a ""high-intensive"" smoking cessation intervention in comparison to a standard intervention can lead to permanent, \>12 months, smoking cessation in a higher proportion.

Methods:

This study is a randomized trial in active smokers with COPD and who have lost less than 50% lung function. A total of 600 participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either a standard treatment (guideline-based municipal smoking cessation programme, ""low intensity"" group), or an intervention group (""high-intensity"" group), which consists of group sessions, telephone consultations, behavior design, hotline, ""buddy-matching"" (smoker matched with COPD patient who stopped). Both groups will receive pharmacological smoking cessation.

Discussion:

The potential benefit of this project is to prevent smoking-related exacerbations of COPD and thereby reduce logistics and costs of hospitalization and treatment of COPD. In addition, the project can potentially benefit from increasing the quality of life and longevity of COPD patients and reducing the risk of developing lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases.",['pharmacological smoking cessation'],['']

NCT03361371,"Research Questions:

Primary:

In otherwise healthy infants 4 weeks to 12 months of age discharged home from the ED with acute bronchiolitis,1 is there a difference in the probability of ""treatment failure"" by 72 hours post discharge from the index ED visit in those receiving nasal suctioning via Zo-Li device prior to feeds compared to infants who receive nasal suctioning via bulb? Treatment failure is defined as 1) any bronchiolitis-related healthcare visit, except visits that have occurred only due to ED-recommendation at time of ED discharge or 2) the use of additional (non-study assigned) suctioning devices (see Outcome Measures section) within approximately 72 hours post discharge at the index ED visit.

Hypothesis:

We hypothesize that the infants who undergo scheduled nasal suctioning via ZoLi device will experience a lower treatment failure probability by approximately 72 hours post discharge from index ED visit compared to those managed by suction via a bulb.

Secondary:

1. In these infants, is there a difference in the mean number of medical visits for bronchiolitis (defined as #1 under primary outcome above) within 72 hours of ED discharge?
2. In these infants, is there a difference in the mean number of unscheduled medical visits for bronchiolitis within 72 hours of ED discharge?
3. In these infants, is there a difference in the mean number of ED visits for bronchiolitis within 72 hours of ED discharge?
4. In these infants, is there a difference in the probability of a parent reporting normal/near normal feeds on approximately 72 hours discharge?
5. In these infants, is there a difference in the probability of a parent reporting normal/near normal sleeping on approximately 72 hours post ED discharge?
6. For the parent, is there a difference in the probability of a parent reporting their own normal/near normal sleeping on approximately 72 hours post ED discharge?
7. In these infants, is there a difference in the probability of parents reporting at 72 hours post ED discharge as being ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their ability to care for their child during the study period?

The sample size calculation is based on the assessment of the between-group difference in probability of treatment failure. The estimated total re-visit probability in bronchiolitis based on a recently published study was approximately 35% within 72 hours of ED discharge.49 In our pilot we have found the same rate of treatment failure. This is a superiority study in which the adoption of nasal suctioning will be recommended for future practice if the observed proportion of the primary outcome in this group is significantly lower than in the controls. With 162 patients per arm (324 in total) a two-sided test with a type I error of 0.05 will have 80% power to achieve statistical significance if suctioning reduces the probability of treatment failure from 40% to 25% (i.e. absolute reduction of 15%). This estimate is based on clinically relevant differences agreed upon by study investigators and it also represents an NNT of 7. In the Cochrane review of asthma therapies an NNT of a comparable magnitude led to a change in national practice recommendations.51 Since bronchiolitis and related medical visits are highly prevalent,20 this target difference would also have an important economic impact. Based on our previous bronchiolitis trials, the anticipated refusal rate may be 20%. Given the study design and our past experience, the study non-completion rate and loss to follow-up can safely be assumed to be no higher than 5% each. Therefore, to have complete data on 324 patients we plan to randomize 360 (i.e. 324/ (1 - 0.05) \*(1 - 0.05) and to approach 450 (i.e. 360/ (1 - 0.20).","['Zo-Li device', 'bulb']","['', '']"

NCT06163833,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an alteration of brain function caused by an external force. Long-term mortality in TBI is substantial, TBI survivors can develop chronic progressive disabilities and have a life expectancy shortened by 6 years. Treatment consists in supportive therapy directed at prevention of second insults, but no neuroprotective therapy is available. Given the multifaceted nature of TBI, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an ideal candidate: they release multiple soluble factors shown to ameliorate the injury microenvironment through immunomodulatory, protective, reparative and regenerative processes. Preclinical data across a range of different TBI models and injury severities show that human MSCs improve outcome through pleiotropic mechanisms of protection and repair. Thus, data indicate MSCs as strong therapeutic candidate and support a clinical study in TBI.

Aim: the study is designed to assess the safety and the efficacy of the MSCs, intravenously administered in severe TBI patients within 48h from injury. The study will be conducted in a stepwise manner. Step 1 will enroll 36 patients (randomized 1:1:1 in arms 80 x 10\^6 MSCs vs 160 x 10\^6 MSCs vs placebo) to define safety, and will allow to select the most promising dose. Step 2 will enroll 30 patients (1:1 in arms MSCs selected dose vs placebo) to define the MSC activity based on the quantification of the plasmatic levels of the neurofilament light (NFL) at 14 days, as biomarker of neuronal damage.

Secondary objectives are aimed to assess:

1. brain injury evolution and white matter damage by longitudinal neuroimaging (at 4 days and 14 days post-TBI and at 6 months)
2. brain immunomodulatory changes by temporal profiling of circulating biomarkers of brain damage and neuroinflammation (daily for 3 days after TBI, at day 7 and 14, and at 1, 6 and 12 months)
3. clinical outcome by a structured clinical and neuropsychological assessment at both 6 and 12 months

Methods: a multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive phase II dose finding study.

Duration of the study: 36 months (24 of enrolment and 12 of follow up).

NCT00473343,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon illumination.

For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the endogenous photoactive porphyrins. The most commonly used precursors have been 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix®, contains the methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion selectivity .

BCC is a highly frequent skin malignancy, and accounts for approximately 75% of all non-melanoma skin cancers. It is the most common cancer in humans. Several non-pharmacological treatment modalities are used for BCC, including excision surgery, curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery and more advanced modalities like radiation therapy, plastic surgery with reconstruction and Moh's surgery. The treatment used depends on the type, size, depth and localisation of the BCC lesion. Treatment options for BCC give good response rates in the majority of participants but are inadequate in a small group of participants defined as ""high-risk"" BCC.

In this particular participant group, even a moderate complete response rate with good cosmetic results may be considered beneficial, since the number of participant who have to receive more advanced therapy with the possibility of high morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome was reduced. Even a partial response is of clinical interest since the remaining tumour was require less extensive surgery. In the case of treatment failure, Metvix PDT does not interfere with the use of other treatment modalities.

NCT05213650,"Today, the increasing aesthetic expectations of the patients, showing its effect in the field of orthodontics, leads to the orientation towards aesthetic materials. The Invisalign system is also polyurethane for aesthetic purposes.

It is a series of transparent plaques personalized to the patient's problems. However, the transparent structure of the plaque increases the importance of its cleanliness.

There are many studies evaluating the removal of bacterial biofilm from plaques. However There are minimal studies evaluating the effect of the materials used for cleaning on the light transmittance, which has a significant effect on the aesthetics of the plaques.

The aim of this study is to compare 5 different agents' effects on colour change.

The work created will be divided into 5 groups according to the cleaning materials used.

One of the cleaning agents will be assigned by lot and will be used while the treatment processes are continuing.

The colour measurement will be carried out using the VITA Easyshade Compact spectrophotometer (VITA Zahnfabrik DEASYC220, Bad Sackingen, Germany). To prevent external light interference and keep the measurement head in a fixed position for each measurement, a special cubic box with a 3 mm radius entrance was created. The head of the device was firmly attached to the box lid with black tape to increase light-tightness. The colour measurement will be performed from the occlusal region of the second premolar tooth on the aligners, which will be placed on a standard white background. The colour measurement will be carried out as received and after the aligners were used in the patient's mouth for 2 weeks. Prior to measurements, the spectrophotometer will be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each measurement will be repeated three times, and the average value will be determined. The Commision de l'Eclairage (CIE) Lab\* system will be used for colour measurements. This system uses three parameters to define colour. The L\* coordinate is a brightness measure that ranges from 0 (black) to 100 (white); the a\* coordinate is horizontal and shows chromatic coordinates between red (+) and green (-), and the b\* coordinate is also horizontal and extends in the direction of yellow (b+) and blue (b-). To determine the colour difference, a formula (Formula 1) will be used. ∆L, ∆a, and ∆b values will be calculated by subtracting the starting measurements (L0, a0, b0) from the final measurements (L1, a1, b1). The ∆E value will be calculated using these values, and the colour difference between groups will be compared.

∆E2-1 = \[(∆L)2 + (+ (∆a)2 + (∆b)2\]1/2= \[(L1-L0)2 + (a1-a0)2 + (b1-b0)2\]1/2 The formula proposed by Filho and da Silva will be used to convert ΔE values to National Bureau of Standards (NBS) values. NBS unit = ΔE\* × 0.92. The ΔE values will be converted to their clinical significance using the NBS system.

According to the results of the research, the colour change of the agents used to clean Invisalign aligners will be determined.

The use of agents that have a minor effect on aesthetics can be considered ideal according to the results of the study",['Invisalign'],['']

NCT03825991,"Introduction: Studies focusing on back pain do not compare different types of back pain diagnosis in relation to a specific psychiatric comorbidity, nor if the presence of psychiatric comorbidity affects treatment. There are limited knowledge on pharmacological treatment of back pain disorders,and especially if the presence of psychiatric comorbidity is an ad-on to the dosage of medication prescribed. Investigating the use of opioids and other pain medication in back patients and the potential effect of concomitant psychiatric comorbidity as well as taking psychiatric medication under consideration is therefore relevant.

Aim: This aim of this PhD thesis is:

1) to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with back pain disorders (BPD) compared to patients with no back pain. 2) Investigate if psychiatric comorbidity affects the type of treatment given. 3) Examine if the presence of psychiatric comorbidity affects the levels of pharmacological treatment given with a focus on both pain medication, such as opioids, as well as treatment with psychotropic medication.

Methods:The association between back pain disorders and psychiatric comorbidity will be investigated using population-based registry data. The population will be defined as adult patients (+18) with a relevant back pain disorder using The National Danish Patient Registry.

The following registries will be also utilized: A subdivision of the DNPR, the National Patient Registry - Psychiatry (NPD-Psych), The Danish National Prescription Database, The Danish National Health Service Register and the DREAM database. By using the Danish Civil Registry and the unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish citizens at birth, data across registries can be linked on an individual level.

Ethics:The Region of Southern Denmark is the data controller for this project, and it is included in their records of personal data processing activities (file no. (18/3337).). Additional approvals or consents were not needed for this project based exclusively on national registries according to Danish law. The data processing was conducted according to EU and Danish legislation on processing of sensitive personal information and, as complies with internal regulations from the Region of Southern Denmark.","['opioids', 'pain medication', 'psychotropic medication']","['', '', '']"

NCT06340139,"Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that encompasses a number of disorders specifically affecting social skills, Communication and present with Rapid repetitive behaviors. Autism spectrum disorder also presents with inability of body to process sensory information which can causes symptoms such as balance deficits, sensitivity to certain sounds or an exaggerated reaction to a normal stimulus. Autism spectrum disorder can affect the quality of life of an individual to a severe extent. This disorder due to sensory processing deficits also shows difficulty in motor planning, coordination and execution of tasks which can make performing activities of daily living highly difficult to perform. It is called a developmental disorder because it affects the growth. Milestones are often delayed in individuals with autism. Due to these deficits individual with autism if not provided with therapies at the right age can stay dependent on caretaker for their whole life. Rapid repetitive behaviors also known as self-stimulatory behaviors are a way to compensate with anxiety, difficulty in processing sensory information and are often used to stimulate themselves to feel calm. Though not a diagnostic symptom autism often still presents with vestibular dysfunction which affects the balance. Several individuals with autism have showed abnormal vestibular ocular reflexes; abnormally long latency of saccades.

NCT05120414,"Stroke is a disorder in which the areas of the brain that control the sensory and motor nerves are damaged due to poor blood supply to the brain. As a result of which oxygen and nutrients supply to the brain tissues is interrupted. This is either caused by infarction or a bleed in the blood arteries supplying the brain. A stroke occurs when the cerebral blood supply is disrupted, resulting in a localized neurological deficiency. At least 80% of strokes are ischemic, meaning they are caused by a blockage in blood flow, while 15-20% are caused by bleeding into the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. The occurrence of the sudden neurological deficit caused by bleeding in the brain or ischemic damage gives rise to the disturbances in motion, senses, perception, language, and other such functions on the opposite side to the affected side of the brain.

NCT03655821,"Rationale:

Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted folate antagonist, which is primarily indicated for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. Dosing of cytotoxic agents like pemetrexed requires balancing the dual risk of sub-therapy and toxicity. Administration of pemetrexed to patients with a creatinine clearance \<45 ml/min is currently not advised. Pemetrexed is dosed based on body surface area (BSA), while renal function and dose are the sole determinants for systemic exposure. This causes 3 major issues:

1. In patients with renal dysfunction, BSA-based dosing may lead to haematological toxicity
2. Patients have to discontinue treatment due to declining renal function, and are withheld effective treatment
3. Even in patients with adequate renal function (GFR \>45 ml/min) treatment may be improved by individualized dosing based on renal function, resulting in less toxicity. Also, BSA-based dosing may lead to ineffective therapy in patients with above average renal function.

The investigators aim to address these problems.

Objective: The overall main objective is to develop a safe and effective individualized dosing regimen for pemetrexed.

Study design: IMPROVE-II is an open label, double arm, randomized study to compare renal function-based dosing of pemetrexed versus BSA-based dosing on attainment of therapeutic exposure.

Study population: IMPROVE-II includes 94 patients with NSCLC or mesothelioma that are eligible for pemetrexed treatment.

Intervention: patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (BSA-based dosing according drug label) or to Arm B (renal function based dosing). The renal function-based dose will be calculated to reach the target AUC. Pharmacokinetic assessment after administration will be performed after the first pemetrexed dose in both arms.

Main study endpoints: The fraction (percentage) of patients with attainment of therapeutic exposure with BSA-based dosing versus renal function-based dosing.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

The investigators consider the extra burden from participating in the planned studies limited. The extra interventions compared to routine care, consist of sampling extra blood. The pharmacokinetic assessments require placement of one additional intravenous catheter. To ensure minimal impact of study participation on daily life, a limited sampling strategy will be used. Patients may benefit from participating in IMPROVE I and -II, as they will be treated with a potentially safe and effective drug that is dosed individually, which prevents toxic exposure.",['Pemetrexed'],['pemetrexed']

NCT01999309,"Rationale: There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these patients, these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk. The combination of well-established vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by simvastatin offers a highly attractive potential to further improve the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.

Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptoms, improves cognition, attenuates brain volume loss, and decreases the risk for metabolic syndrome as well as for movement disorders, when compared to placebo.

Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given for one year in addition to antipsychotic medication to patients with psychotic disorder. We expect lower symptom severity as measured with the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and less cognitive decline as measured with the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia).Secondary objectives are assessment of general functioning, presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and degree of movement disorders, and assessments of brain volume.

NCT03076151,"Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor widely used for the prevention of allograft rejection in solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. It is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. Adoport® is an immediate-release formulation of tacrolimus, to be administered twice daily. Because of a narrow therapeutic window and a better correlation between pre-dose level and effects than between dose and effect, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) based on trough whole blood tacrolimus concentrations is recommended for Adoport®. TDM helps to minimize the risk of acute rejection and the occurrence of adverse effects (mainly nephrotoxicity and, to a lesser extent, neurotoxicity).

As reported in a consensus document from a consortium of European experts on tacrolimus TDM, the interdose area-under-the curve (AUC0-12h) is expected to be the best marker of tacrolimus exposure. However, tacrolimus monitoring based on full AUC0-12h is difficult to set up in routine, due to clinical constraints and the necessity of multiple samples. Calculation of the AUC0-12h using Bayesian estimation and a limited sampling strategy, i.e. a few blood samples collected during the early phase post-dose would represent an elegant solution, as already done for other tacrolimus formulations.

Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tacrolimus is influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism within intron 3 of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5). Patients who carry at least one CYP3A5\*1 allele are considered to be CYP3A5 expressors (about 12% of the Caucasian population, Hapmap project) and thus require a 1.5 to 2-fold higher starting dose than CYP3A5\*3/\*3 carriers to reach the predefined target exposure early after transplantation. Although this polymorphism showed no impact on the performance of the Bayesian estimators previously developed for other tacrolimus formulation, the patient status for CYP3A5\*3 will be considered in this pharmacokinetic study as a potential covariate in, or confounding factor of, the PK model. Specifically, owing to a 12% frequency in the White European population, about 4 patients carriers of the CYP3A5\*1 allele are expected in this study; the performance of the PK model and Bayesian estimator developed will be specifically evaluated in this subgroup.","['Tacrolimus', 'Adoport']","['tacrolimus', '']"

NCT03821519,"The haematological neoplasia relapse is the cause of higher mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). When transplantation fails the most common therapeutic strategy is to increase the antitumor activity of the donor's immune system through the infusion of donor Lymphocytes (DLI). The use of DLI may limit the relapse, but may induce transplantation disease against the host (GvHD), in 40-60% of patients. With advances in transplantation procedures, the use of non-compatible (HLA-mismatched) haploidentical (aplo) donor cells has become feasible and is increasing. However, strategies for immune control of relapse after HSCT from haploidentical donor are hampered by the absence of prospective data that can guide treatment and limit the induction of GvHD in the setting of the HLA difference between the donor and the recipient. Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (CIK) are T lymphocytes from haploidentical donor expressing CD56 (e.g., double positive cells at CD3 / CD56). CIK are a product of advanced cell therapy (Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product, ATMP) for somatic cell therapy and have a reduced histocompatibility (MHC) complex: are cytotoxic, anti-tumor cells, possess the characteristics of both T cells and Natural Killer (NK) and show in vivo a very strong cytolytic activity against leukemia, but a low reactivity against the host. Therefore, this study has as its primary objective to investigate the safety of CIK cells deriving from the donor, especially in terms of the onset of GvHD, used as a treatment for relapse after transplantation with haploidentical stem cells.

NCT04403672,"The novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C0V 2) originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As of April 15 2020, the virus has spread across 213 countries/territories with 1,914,916 cases and 123,010 deaths and a crude case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4%. In Bangladesh, the situation is also grave. As of May 14, 2020, there were 18,863 cases and 283 deaths.

In order to suppress COVID-19 transmission, it is important to diagnose COVID-19 patients, which would help in the process of quarantine and isolation of the patients and also in contact tracing. COVID-19 testing can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus and includes methods that detect the presence of virus itself such as real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), isothermal nucleic acid amplification, antigen) and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. Until now, RT-PCR has been known as the best approach for - detection. It would be very useful if Bangladesh had its own locally produced RT-PCR kits, provided that the kits are no less in quality than imported kits in terms of sensitivity, specificity, price etc. The present study aims to carry out the performance evaluation of RealDetect RT-PCR Kit for COVID-19 detection.

The RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnostic panel is a locally produced real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals who meet SARS-CoV-2 clinical criteria. The approach is based on the RT-PCR method which uses two (Nucleocapsid 1, Nucleocapsid 2) sets of gene-specific primers and corresponding fluorescent probes to detect two specific regions within the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein Nucleocapsid gene. This RT-PCR panel detects SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) specifically. The approach does not generate any false positives to other coronaviruses or human microflora. The kit also contains a primer-probe set which detects human housekeeping gene, ribonuclease Protein (RNase P). That is, the Ribonuclease Protein (RNase P) serves as an internal reference control to monitor sample collection, ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, and amplification.

This is a case control study.

NCT05432089,"Introduction: Oxytocin (OT) is a nine-amino acid neuropeptide, known to have a fundamental role in social communication. In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in Shalvata Mental Health Center, OT was administrated to patients suffering from severe mental health illness. The results indicated that OT has a clear beneficial effect on therapeutic outcomes. However, to our knowledge, the effect of OT administration to both patients and therapists on the therapeutic process was never tested. Substance administration to caregivers is therefore possible, and could, in some cases, provide further knowledge about the caregiving dynamics. Since we know the therapist's characteristics effect the therapeutic alliance and that OT is associated with the therapeutic alliance, patient-therapist bond, and therapy outcome, we are led to ask if OT administration to patients and therapists could allow for a deeper understanding of OT's effects on the therapeutic process.

Another variable found to be associated with the therapeutic process is Physiological Synchronization. Physiological Synchronization (PS) is a primarily interpersonal phenomenon which includes coordination of physiological signals between two or more interacting individuals. Despite the rising number of studies examining PS, its physiological and psychological mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. Based on literature indicating associations between OT and PS, and associations each of them has with the therapeutic process and its facilitators, in this study we wish to examine the influence of OT on PS through intranasal OT administration to patients alone and to patients and therapists together.

Research Hypotheses:

1. Patients receiving OT will demonstrate higher levels of PS during the measured session compared to patients receiving placebo.
2. Patients receiving OT will report higher levels of perceived therapist empathy as compared to patients receiving placebo.
3. These associations will be stronger when both patient and therapist receive OT in comparison to patient alone.
4. Changed in PS and empathy will be associated with OT even after controlling for patient rated alliance and session impact.
5. These findings will sustain after controlling for severity of symptoms and attachment patterns.

Method:

Participants. Sixty patients and their therapists will be recruited for the pilot study. Patients will be recruited from the inpatient adult psychiatric wards at Shalvata Mental Health Center. Therapists in this study will be comprised of psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, in different stages of seniority and training.

Instruments. Attachment patterns, symptom severity, side effects and therapeutic process measurements - working alliance, perceived empathy and session impact - will be assessed using self-report questionnaires. PS will be measured by recordings of the electrodermal activity (EDA) measured by skin conductance signals, using a galvanic skin response (GSR) device. Oxytocin Administration will be performed intranasally using a spray containing 24U.

Procedure. Sixty patients meeting inclusion criteria and their therapists will be recruited for the pilot study. Dyads will be randomized and double-blindly allocated to receive intra-nasal oxytocin or placebo. Dyads will be followed for two consecutive sessions, approximately at their fourth and fifth sessions. After signing informed consent forms, patients and therapists will complete therapeutic process measurements, and patients will be assessed for the severity of their symptoms and attachment patterns. Prior to the first session, patients will be administrated with either IN-OT or PLC and will wait for 30 minutes before the beginning of the session. Skin conductance synchrony will be measured during the session. At the end of the session, therapeutic process measurements will be assessed in both patients and therapists, and patients will complete a side-effect questionnaire. Prior to the second session, both patients and therapists will receive either IN-OT or PLC (each dyad will receive the same substance) and will wait for 30 minutes before the beginning of the session. Skin conductance synchrony will then be measured during the session. At the end of the session, therapeutic process measurements will be assessed in both patients and therapists alongside with a side-effect questionnaire.

The uniqueness of the proposed study is rooted in the view of the psychotherapy dyad as undetached, by focusing on the dyad and not on the patient alone. Focusing on patient-therapist synchronization lies on the understanding of the patient-therapist bond as co-dependent and co-affected. Such research could increase our understanding of PS between patient and therapist and its meaning in psychotherapy research and practice.","['oxytocin', 'IN-OT', 'PLC']","['oxytocin', '', '']"
NCT06067464,"In order to monitor and improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) quality, there is need for tools that provide real time feedback to responders. The use of invasive arterial pressure monitoring and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) as quality measures of CPR. Invasive pressure measurements are timeconsuming and cumbersome in resuscitation situations, and are very rarely practical. ETCO2 measurements require presence of a capnometer with an advanced airway.

High quality chest compression will result inETCO2 between 2-2.5KPa. A rapid increase in ETCO2 on waveform capnography may enable ROSC to be detected while continuing chest compression and can be used as a tool to withhold the next dose of bolus adrenaline injection.

Pulse oximetry, which noninvasively detects the blood flow of peripheral tissue, has achieved widespread clinical use. It was noticed that the pulse waveform frequency can reflect the rate and interruption time of chest compression(CC) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR).

The perfusion index (PI) is obtained from pulse oximetry and is computed as the ratio of the pulsatile (alternating current) signal to the non-pulsatile (direct current) signal of infra-red light, expressed as a percentage;PI =ACIR/DCIR∗100% (i.e. AC = pulsatile component of the signal, DC = non-pulsatile component of the signal, IR = infrared light).

PI shows the perfusion status of the tissue in the applied area for an instant and a certain time interval. The PI value ranges from 0.02% (very weak) to 20% (strong).Peripheral PI has been proposed for different clinical uses with some applications in critical patients.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of pulse-oximeter derived perfusion index for high quality CPR and as aprognostication tool of ROSC during in-hospital cardiac arrest in comparison to ETCO2 reading.",['adrenaline'],['']

NCT05863169,"The aim of the following study is to investigate which is the best region of interest (ROI) for a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback (NF) training for highly-impulsive individuals (and consequently also patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Generally, NF trainings aim to improve the neurophysiological as well as cognitive-behavioral deficits observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders and were shown to constitute an effective complementary treatment option for patients with ADHD. Some previous studies used the DLPFC as a ROI for NF training, while others focused on the IFG as the main target region. However, so far, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of NF trainings targeting the DLPFC vs. IFG using the same protocol or the specificity of regulation efforts between these two areas using fNIRS. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of fNIRS-NF using the DLPFC as a ROI with fNIRS-NF using the IFG as a ROI in a randomized controlled study design with highly-impulsive, healthy participants.

Furthermore, the investigators aim to test the effect of fNIRS-NF training in the context of stress. Previous studies reported that there is a strong connection between ADHD and stress. However, the effect of fNIRS-NF training for the adaptation to stressful situations is uncertain.

To this end, the investigators will assess the brain activity of participants before and after an fNIRS-NF training period during performance of a Go/NoGo task, an n-back task and The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). It is hypothesized that both trainings will be successful in reducing impulsive behavior; however, in the pre/post testing, specific effects of fNIRS-based NF of the DLPFC are expected on working memory function and of fNIRS-based NF of the IFG on inhibitory control (Go/NoGo task). Correlations between both functions and impulsive symptoms will give an indication which training ROI may be more promising for the treatment of (specific subgroups of) ADHD. Correlations between regulation of different training ROIs will indicate the specificity of feedback regulation of circumscribed cortical areas.",[],[]

NCT01868490,"Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells exhibit high proliferation rate and cytotoxic activity in vitro. The major effector cells are the CD3+CD56+ subset. The cytolytic activity of CIK cells being independent of MHC restriction implies feasibility in using CIK cells allogeneic to the tumors. Experiments to block the MHC class-I and -II pathways on tumors-RNA transfected DCs showed that only MHC class-I blocking led to a significant reduction of heterogeneous CIK cells cytotoxicity after the co-culture. The safety of CIK cells was demonstrated by the lack of cytotoxicity toward autologous as well as allogeneic normal cells. Co-culture of CIK cells with dendritic cells (DCs) has been reported by us and others in a myriad of cancer (e.g., cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, renal \& colon carcinoma, murine leukemia \& lymphoma showing enhancement of anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CIK cell in all. The co-culture of CIK cells with DCs were reported to decrease the number of professional regulatory/ suppressor T cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+ cells) and decrease the secretion of IL-10, an immune suppressor cytokine, whereas the cytotoxic activity against target cells increased.

We have recently brought CIK cells through the preclinical phase (animal study) of human cholangiocarcinoma treatment. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), is a bile duct epithelial cancer endemic in the Northeast of Thailand, with an increasing incidence discernible in Europe and North America. Conventional treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation do not bring satisfactory survival due to anatomic location, presence of metastases, and high recurrent rates. These unsatisfactory outcomes urge to search innovative treatments such as immunotherapy. We reported the safety and efficacy of CIK cells in SCID mice model for cholangiocarcinoma. Several conditions of human CIK cells were examined using ex vivo cytotoxic assay and SCID mice pre-inoculated with human cholangiocarcinoma cells. We monitored the ex vivo cytotoxicity, tumor sizes and immunohistochemistry. Optimal tumor suppression was observed when CIK cells were pre-exposed to dendritic cells (DCs). Tumor-infiltrating human CD3+ cells were observed from day 2 - 14, but not in normal tissues elsewhere. These altogether indicated the specific homing of CIK cells to tumor mass. All animals did not exhibit any noticeable adverse reaction from the CIK treatments. The CD3+CD56+ cells are logical candidates for clinical trial while the DC-co-cultured CIK cells produced similar efficacy and more feasible for clinical application.

With a complete array of in vitro and in vivo study, the next rational step is moving forward to phase I/II clinical trials for a number of specified solid tumors (i.e., cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and glioblastoma multiforme, nueroblastoma) using the optimized autologous CIK cells. Subjects without prior exposure to or weaned for at least 3 months from chemotherapy can be recruited to maintain the integrity of their immunological system, a critical factor for a successful immunotherapy.","['CIK cells', 'DCs', 'IL-10']","['', '', '']"

NCT01572922,"Iron overload is a severe complication of multiple blood transfusions. As the body has no physiologic mechanism for clearing iron, repeated transfusions cause iron accumulation in organs and lead to iron toxicity. Accurate assessment of iron overload is paramount to quantify excessive iron accumulation and to monitor response to iron chelation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been used to noninvasively measure hepatic iron concentration (HIC). Although MRI-based measurements of transverse relaxation rates (R2 and R2\*) accurately predict biopsy-proven HICs below 15 mg Fe/g, previous studies have shown that their precision is limited for HICs above 15 mg Fe/g and inaccurate above 25 mg Fe/g. Current R2\* gradient-echo (GRE) MR techniques fail occasionally for very high iron overloads (HIC \~ 15-25 mg Fe/g) and always for massive iron overloads (HIC \> 25 mg Fe/g) because R2\* is so high that the MR signal decays before it can be measured accurately.

NCT04843059,"Vitiligo affects 1 to 2% of worldwide population and has a demonstrated impact on the quality of life.

Optimal treatment of vitiligo requires to target the auto-immune inflammatory response (to halt the depigmentation process), in particular T cells, but also to induce the differentiation of melanocyte stem cells (to induce repigmentation). Ultimately, the treatment should also prevent the recurrences of depigmentation. Indeed, when repigmentation is achieved, 40 to 50% of lesions reoccur within one year, suggesting that skin resident memory T cell clones remain in repigmented vitiligo skin and might explain these recurrences.

The investigators hypothesize that a very early intervention could prevent the accumulation of the skin resident memory T cells in vitiligo lesions. Moreover, they also think that such an early treatment would also optimize the repigmentation process, even in traditionally resistant areas, as some remaining pre-melanocytes and maybe even some melanocytes, could proliferate and recolonize the epidermis.

Objectives : to compare the resident memory T-cell infiltrate in perilesional vitiligo skin after 6 months of treatment with OMP and UVB, between three groups of patients suffering from non-segmental vitiligo Interventions The 3 groups will receive a combination of narrowband UVB (Nb-UVB) 3 times a week and oral mini pulses of systemic steroids (5 mg of d medrol 16mg twice a week) for 24 weeks.

Three visits will be done (inclusion, Week 12 and 24) A skin biopsy will be done on lesional and peri-lesional area at baseline. Another skin biopsy will be taken after 24 weeks but only in perilesional area. A blood sample for assessing the circulating memory T cells and for checking the tolerance will be performed at baseline, then at W12 and W24.

The combination of narrowband UVB and oral minipulse of steroids are considered as a standard care of active vitiligo patients. Clinical assessment (including blood pressure) and hemogram, liver enzymes, urea, creatinemia, glycemia, natremia and kaliema will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.

Main criteria of evaluation:

The target lesion will be chosen before any treatment. The minimal size will be 2cm². Considering that skin on the face usually responds very well whilst that of hands and feet respond poorly, to avoid potential bias due to the location of treatment, these locations won't be taken as target lesions. In any cases, no biopsy will be taken on the face or in the folds.","['OMP', 'UVB', 'systemic steroids', 'medrol']","['', '', '', '']"

NCT01632046,"Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is the preferred treatment modality in children with end-stage renal disease. Unfortunately progressive alterations of the peritoneal membrane occur with time on PD, leading to a continuous loss of peritoneal transport function. Recently, double-chambered PD solutions with less Glucose Degradation Products (GDPs) and neutral pH have been approved for the European market. Short term administration suggests comparable clearance rates compared with conventional solutions. In vitro studies demonstrate an improved local immune defense system. To compensate for metabolic acidosis, the available solutions either contain lactate or bicarbonate, the impact of either buffer on long term acidosis control and peritoneal membrane integrity, however, is unknown.

The prospective, European multi-center study will provide the first long term administration of pH neutral, low GDP solutions in children. 60 children will randomly be treated with a bicarbonate (BicaVera) and a lactate based solution (Balance), respectively. The primary end point will be the effect of either PD-solution on peritoneal transport characteristics (D/P Creatinine). Secondary end-points will be the effects on ultrafiltration capacity, acid-base balance, peritoneal morphology, incidence and severity of peritonitis, and on surrogate parameters of biocompatibility and carbonyl stress. Moreover, potential genetic determinants of the peritoneal transporter status and of the continued morphological transformation of the peritoneum will be assessed.

NCT01592994,"This grant involved the development, implementation, and assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of an HIV prevention intervention for at-risk wives in Mumbai, RHANI Wives (Raising HIV Awareness among Non-Infected Indian Wives). The RHANI Wives intervention was adapted from the HIV Intervention Program (HIV-IP), a community-based, multi-session HIV intervention with demonstrated effectiveness among Latinas whose primary risk for HIV was from their primary male partner (Raj et al. 2001).

Specific aims of this study are as follows:

1. To adapt HIV-IP, a culture and gender-tailored HIV intervention for Latinas with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing risk for HIV, and to create RHANI Wives for use with at-risk Indian wives.
2. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of RHANI Wives with at risk wives\* in India. A two-group cluster randomized trial will involve random assignment of 12 neighborhood clusters (25 women/cluster) to receive the intervention (n=150) or a control condition (n=150).

NCT03619551,"The investigators want to study if lower doses of chemotherapy will help babies with SCID to achieve good immunity with less short and long-term risks of complications after transplantation. This trial identifies babies with types of immune deficiencies that are most likely to succeed with this approach and offers them transplant early in life before they get severe infections or later if their infections are under control. It includes only patients receiving unrelated or mismatched related donor transplants.

The study will test if patients receiving transplant using either a low dose busulfan or a medium dose busulfan will have immune recovery of both T and B cells, measured by the ability to respond to immunizations after transplant. The exact regimen depends on the subtype of SCID the patient has. Donors used for transplant must be unrelated or half-matched related (haploidentical) donors, and peripheral blood stem cells must be used. To minimize the chance of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the stem cells will have most, but not all, of the T cells removed, using a newer, experimental approach of a well-established technology. Once the stem cell transplant is completed, patients will be followed for 3 years.

NCT04655937,"Stroke survivors face a range of mental health challenges adjusting post-stroke. There is a lack of treatment options and clinical psychologist workforce to deliver support. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been used successfully in clinical services to improve wellbeing.

The investigators worked with stroke survivors, health care professionals and researchers to co-develop group ACT therapy, specifically for stroke survivors, to be delivered using video calling (Zoom). Staff training and supervision programmes were also developed to equip Stroke Association workforce (paraprofessionals) to deliver ACT.

The current study will recruit and train up to 10 professionals with some experience of supporting stroke survivors but no experience of ACT.

We then aim to recruit up to 30 stroke survivors in the community who are at least 4 months post-stroke and experiencing distress adjusting to their stroke. The investigators aimed to make everything accessible for people with mild/moderate difficulties with thinking and communicating. Recruitment took place across England, over a 6 month period.

The study will test how feasible and acceptable it is to deliver the co-developed, remote ACT intervention to stroke survivors, as well as the feasibility of collecting outcomes data:

1. Participants will be invited to consent to complete online measures of well-being every 3 months for up to 12 months (taking around 20 minutes), with the option to participate in group intervention.

NCT06118801,"Abstract According to the definition by World Health Organization; births before the completion of the 37th gestational week are called, preterm birth. Preterm birth is among the most important causes of mortality and morbidity during infancy. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The most common risk factors are, preterm birth, enteral feeding and bacterial colonization.

Late Onset Sepsis (LOS) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the preterm infants. A healthy gut microbiota has a key role in developing and maintaining a balanced immune response and establishing the intestinal barrier in the immediate postnatal period. Probiotics come to the fore as means that may be effective in preventing NEC and LOS.

Although it is widely accepted that, breast milk has its own microbiota, the origin of these bacterial populations in the milk, has not been fully understood. The new information regarding especially the anaerobic species associated with the intestinal environments that cannot be found in the aerobic environments, suggests an endogenous route to the mammary gland through the presence of the entero-mammary pathway.

The aim of this project is to determine the effect of the probiotics added to the maternal diet on the incidence of encountering NEC and LOS in the preterm infants. The unique value of this project is that, 80 ml of probiotic yogurt will be given to mothers of the preterm infants, who still breastfeed their babies, for 20 days and the effects on the baby will be examined in the scope of the study.

The study has been planned to be conducted as a randomized controlled study in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital. The power analysis was performed with G\*Power for the sample size of the study, which has an experimental/control design structure. The sample size was determined as 50 in total. Data collection tools were organized as Mother and Infant Introductory Information Form (23 questions), Mother and Infant Follow-up Form during Probiotic Implementation (7 questions). At the beginning of the study, all mothers will fill out the mother and baby introductory information form, and the mothers in the experimental group will be given 80 ml probiotic yogurt support once a day for 20 days. In addition to that, all the babies will be monitored for growth once a week, throughout the process. Their status of regular breastfeeding, whether they are diagnosed with NEC and LOS, the time of transition to oral feeding, their bilirubin levels, their status of receiving phototherapy and their discharge durations will be evaluated, and a questionnaire that consists of scale questions will be applied after the discharge.

As a result of this project, it is aimed with the probiotic that will be added to maternal nutrition to reduce the encounter of NEC and LOS in preterm infants, to positively affect the intestinal microbiota by preventing dysbiosis in these infants, to protect them from very important problems such as NEC and LOS as well as accelerating the transition to oral feeding, to help them gain weight, to shorten the duration of receiving phototherapy and hospitalization by reducing the bilirubin levels.","['probiotics', 'yogurt']","['', '']"

NCT00247780,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in the left atrium using radiofrequency energy is a new and promising non-medical treatment in patients with symptomatic AF with reported success rates of 65 % to 90 % depending on AF classification and ablation procedure. However, the risk of recurrence has led to suggestions of how to improve the clinical outcome by tailoring a more efficient ablation procedure. A prospective, randomised study with 150 patients with symptomatic AF referred for PVI has been initiated and patients are allocated to PVI alone (75 patients) or PVI with additional ablation in the right atrium (75 patients). Patients undergo extensive monitoring of the heart rhythm during follow-up to document symptomatic or asymptomatic AF or atrial flutter. The presence of asymptomatic AF after PVI could potentially affect the management of the anticoagulation therapy in these patients. The structural and functional changes in the atria after PVI is characterized by new imaging techniques (Tissue Doppler Imaging(TDI))of the atria and cardiac neurohormones. TDI may be an effective tool for characterising changes in the left atrial function after PVI. Neurohormones may provide new information regarding the changes in left atrial function and clinical outcome after PVI in patients with AF.

We hypothesize that:

* Among patients with predominant atrial fibrillation, PVI with additional ablation in the right atrium is associated with better outcome, i.e. freedom of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter overall.
* Asymptomatic AF and atrial flutter occur frequently after PVI.
* Left atrial volume and systolic function correlates to AF recurrence after PVI.

NCT04957602,"Currents strategies for cancer diagnosis consist of the extraction of a solid tissue from the affected area. This sample enables the study of specific biomarkers and the genetic nature of the tumor.

However, the tissue extraction is risky and painful for the patient and in some cases is unavailable in inaccessible tumors.

In addition, cancer is a dynamic disease and during the course of disease, cancers generally become more heterogeneous. As a result of this heterogeneity, the bulk tumour might include a diverse collection of cells harbouring distinct molecular signatures with differential levels of sensitivity to treatment. This heterogeneity might result in a non-uniform distribution of genetically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations across and within disease sites (spatial heterogeneity) or temporal variations in the molecular makeup of cancer cells (temporal heterogeneity).

To overcome these drawbacks, new alternatives are rising up, such as liquid biopsy.

A liquid biopsy is the analysis of biomarkers in a non-solid biological tissue, mainly blood, which has remarkable advantages over the traditional method; it has no risk, it is non-invasive and painless, it does not require surgery and reduces cost and diagnosis time.

Of the various circulating biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have particularly opened new windows. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are released into the bloodstream from primary cancer, metastasis, and even from a disseminated tumor cell reservoir.

CTCs may ideally replace tissue biopsies in the prediction and monitoring of therapeutic responses and tumor recurrence. CTCs can be used to guide therapeutic cancer management and serve as drug targets.

There are a wide range of instruments and methods for capturing, enriching, and enumerating CTCs. However, none of them is considered optimal.

To improve the purity of CTCs, the study consortium has developed a cutting-edge microfluidic device (LUTON) to reduce leukocytes contamination while preserving CTCs viability.

The added-value of the study innovation has been validated on clinical cell lines. The aim of this study is now to determine the performance of the device using patients' blood samples.

For this purpose, CTCs from non-small cell lung metastatic cancer patients will be isolated using ClearCellFX1 before injection into the LUTON workflow.

NCT04661254,"Kidney and liver transplantation requires a fine tuning of immune responses in order to achieve long term operational tolerance with immunosuppressants or immune modulators. Numerous experimental findings indicate that CD4+ FOXP3 expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells play a central role in the induction of tolerance to the grafts indicating that the use of Treg cells may be an innovative therapeutic strategy in kidney transplantation that would enable the diminution of immunosuppressive drugs or even their discontinuation, thus decreasing their risk of adverse events.

As human Treg cells represent less than 10% of CD4+ T cells, and because it has been shown in mice that a dose of 2\*104 polyclonal Tregs/g was necessary to induce tolerance in animal models of solid organ transplantation, it is mandatory to expand human Treg cells ex vivo, after isolating them from peripheral blood. The investigators previously defined a protocol for Treg cell isolation and expansion in clinical grade conditions (cGMP) that enabled us to obtain the expected number of expanded cells maintaining high levels of FOXP3 (3).

The investigators therefore hypothesize in humans, as it has been already shown in mice, that the infusion of autologous expanded polyclonal Treg cells would lead to the obtaining of operational tolerance in kidney and liver graft in association with classical immunosuppressants and an expectable diminution of those.

Iron rim lesions can be detected through their appearance on susceptibility-based brain MRI at either 3-Tesla or 7-Tesla strength. We know that the formation of chronic active lesions is not uniform across MS cohorts so identifying risk factors which predispose individuals to the formation of rim lesions may provide a useful biomarker for clinical progression. One candidate set of risk factors include genetic variants which prevent some MS patients from resolving acute inflammation following their initial wave of inflammatory demyelination at lesion onset.

Additionally, only small longitudinal clinical cohorts have reported the evolution of iron rim lesions many years after their initial formation, as well as their link to clinical disability or disease progression.

NCT05057156,"Background: Epilepsy leads to cognitive impairment in 20-50%. Compared to seizures, these cognitive disorders are a major additional factor in occupational, social and family disability. Memory and language skills are most often impaired. These disorders are well described, multifactorial, but no therapy (drug and/or non-drug) has been validated to date. Recently, cognitive remediation techniques have shown benefits in certain neurological pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis. In adult epilepsy, few previous cognitive remediation studies were performed but suffer significant methodological shortcomings that limit the scope of their results. Studies that have focused on cognitive function have shown promising results for attention and memory. In contrast, in the area of language, no studies have been published.

Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital solution (PRODDIGE\*) on the lexical access capacities in people with epilepsy.

Method: Randomized, multicentric, observational study which will compare the use of a digital solution (PRODDIGE) in total autonomy versus the supervised use by a trained neuropsychologist. A neuropsychological assessment will be provided before and after a period of 4 months of use of the digital solution.

Material: The medical project aims to offer an application of cognitive remediation to patients who suffer from cognitive impairments and especially language disorders.

T The App is like a serious game, it's based on the playfulness of ""game"" and the seriousness of ""medical exercise"". During the exercise the patient can ask for clues help and isn't constrained by time in order to succeed ""his mission"".

Conclusion: This will be the first French speaking app specifically dedicated to rehabilitation of language deficits observed in people with epilepsy. The expected benefits are an improvement of the patients' language complaints, the regular use of an adapted digital solution to improve their language difficulties, but also a better understanding of their disorders and an improvement of their self-esteem.",['PRODDIGE'],['']

NCT01049191,"Osteoporosis is a common disorder of compromised bone strength causing 40-50% of women and \~25% of men to sustain fragility fractures during their lifetime. The reduction of bone strength in osteoporotic people results from loss of bone density and deterioration of bone quality. Bone quality is a complex amalgamation including macro- and micro-architecture, mineralization, turnover and damage accumulation. Currently, medications to reduce fracture risk are prescribed primarily on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Unfortunately, currently available BMD measurement technologies do not detect the aforementioned properties of bone quality; as such, less than half of individuals who sustain osteoporotic fractures are classified as ""osteoporotic"" by currently available diagnostic tools. Clearly, measures to enhance identification of those at high fracture risk are needed. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) technology, such as that provided by MicroMRI, Inc., has outstanding potential to be such a tool. Therefore, our long-term goal is to evaluate and optimize the use of HR-MRI in fracture risk prediction; this pilot work is an essential step in attaining this goal.

This research will investigate 72 postmenopausal women with normal or osteopenic BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 36 with prior low-trauma fractures will be compared with 36 age-, race- and BMD matched women without fracture. We hypothesize that 1.) Women with fractures will have evidence of microarchitectural deterioration on HR-MRI and 2.) Newly developed, more rapid MRI sequences designed at the UW will provide similar trabecular microstructure information more rapidly than the currently used, albeit investigational, technology produced by MicroMRI, Inc.

Our specific aims are to a) Evaluate differences in MicroMRI parameters of trabecular microstructure (bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, surface/curve ratio and erosion index) between age-, race- and BMD-matched postmenopausal women with and without fracture; b.) Correlate T2\* relaxation time (a rapid indirect MRI measure of trabecular density and microstructure) with BMD measured by DXA, and microstructural parameters measured by MicroMRI.

NCT02350400,"Background

Hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer (MCC) is quite common and is a major source of morbidity and mortality. There has been evidence to show that hepatic arterial chemoembolisation using DC beads (drug eluting beads, 100-300μm) loaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) showed improved overall survival when compared to systemic therapy (FOLFIRI), but being larger they have their limitations.

New 70-150μm beads are recently available and currently there is limited data concerning its use. Safety of these beads have not been tested in local patients.

Hypothesis / Aim To study the safety and pharmacokinetics of the smaller 70-150μm DEBIRI in a pilot study of 5 patients. The smaller 70-150μm beads will be able to deliver a more consistent and higher dose to tumoral tissue with a smaller systemic dose. Being smaller and less embolic, it will also be better tolerated. Patients will also be genotyped for their UGT1A1\*28 and UGT1A1\*6 polymorphism status as the latter genotypes are associated with decreased clearance of irinotecan and SN-38 in Asian patients.

Methods Single centre, pilot study, prospectively recruiting 5 patients with unilobar disease, refractory to systemic chemotherapy

The primary endpoints:

1. establish safety and toxicity profile of the irinotecan loaded DEBIRI beads
2. establish pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38.

The secondary outcome measurements:

1. the incidence and severity of adverse events, liver function parameters and laboratory abnormalities;
2. response rate,
3. progression free survival
4. overall survival

Clinical Significance

This treatment modality has the advantage of directly delivering irinotecan to the liver metastases from colorectal cancer. This local mode of drug delivery may result in a higher intratumoral drug concentration and rapid tumour shrinkage leading to downstaging of the hepatic metastatic lesions. These therapeutic outcomes may also downstage patients to hepatic resection.",['irinotecan'],['irinotecan']

NCT01749280,"The aorta is the main blood vessel that comes out of the heart and distributes blood to the whole body. In some people, the aorta becomes swollen (aneurysm) and bursts, especially as it passes through the abdomen. These 'abdominal aortic aneurysms' often occur without symptoms and can burst or rupture without warning. This usually leads to death and represents the thirteenth commonest cause of death in the United Kingdom. In this study, we are looking at a new technique that can look at the aortic aneurysm using magnetic resonance imaging; a technique that does not require x-rays or radiation. We have recently shown that, using magnetic resonance combined with a new imaging agent USPIO, we can detect 'hotspots' of activity in these aneurysms that seem to predict which aneurysms grow rapidly, and are therefore potentially at risk of rupture. We here propose to conduct a study in Edinburgh that will invite all patients who are under surveillance because of an aneurysm. We will image these patients using this novel technique and see if we can identify which patients burst their aneurysm, have an aneurysm that grows so large it needs to have surgery, or die. This will be important to establish as it will potentially lead to a new way of managing people that could ultimately save lives.

NCT02874105,"The rotator cuff tendinopathy is very common and associated with degenerative or traumatic changes of the rotator cuff and/or the sub-acromial bursa or the long head of the biceps. Lesions go of the simple tendinopathy without tear to the full-thickness tear of the cuff which means a loss of mobility or strength. The origin of this pathology remains controversial and many causes have been evoked (subacromial mechanical impingement, degenerative changes, muscle imbalance...). The clinical impairment is not always the same and varies from a painful shoulder with correct range of motion to a pseudoparalysis shoulder. The first treatment of the rotator cuff pathology is always non surgical and consists in relative resting, painkillers and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAD) and physiotherapy. The aim of this management is to relieve pain and to restore the mobility and a good function of the shoulder.

There is no consensus about the physiotherapy protocol for the treatment of the rotator cuff tendinopathy. In France, the most used physiotherapy protocol uses the strengthening of the muscles which stabilize the scapula (rhomboide muscles, trapezius and serratus anterior) and which lower the humerus (pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major). The aim of this approach is to augment the subacromial space in order to decrease the inflammation of the rotator cuff tendons and the associated pain. A technique of Dynamic Humeral Centering (DHC) uses a new method of glenohumeral centering in closed kinetic chain has been described (""3C Concept"" for Centering in a Closed Chain). Dynamic humeral centring (DHC) is a modality of physiotherapy that aims to prevent subacromial impingement of rotator cuff tendons. In order to simplify and to improve its reliability, a special device called Scapuleo® has been developed. The aim of this device is to help the physiotherapist to realize simultaneously a subacromial decompression, a specific strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles and an optimal activation of the lower trapezius and the anterior serratus.

Our hypothesis was that the DHC was not inferior to the conventional physiotherapy protocol for the medical treatment of the rotator cuff tendinopathy without full-thickness tear.

We proposed a prospective and randomized study. All the patients treated in our department for simple tendinopathy of the rotator cuff or partial thickness tear were included in this study after signed consent. The physiotherapy protocol consists in 20 sessions of either ""Conventional program"" (Control group) or ""Dynamic Humeral Centering"" (Study group). The clinical evaluation included the range of motion measurement, Constant Score, Quick-DASH and Oxford Shoulder Score at 3 months and 6 months. Patients were blinded to the study hypothesis.

NCT04647279,"Low back pain and osteoarticular degeneration or injury is the leading worldwide cause of years lost to disability, accounting for 17 % of all patients with disabilities and its burden is growing alongside the increasing and aging population. The anatomical regions of the intervertebral disc include the central nucleus pulposus, the peripheral fibrocartilaginous annulus fibrosus, and the superior and inferior cartilaginous endplates (CEP). The CEP is a thin layer of hyaline cartilage located between the avascular intervertebral disc and the bony vertebral endplate. The endplate cartilage consists of chondrocytes interspersed throughout an extracellular matrix of proteoglycans, collagen (types I and II), and water. It plays an important role in the function and homeostasis. The CEP has been considered the pathway between the largely avascular disk tissues and the blood supply of the vertebral body and thus provides nutrition for disk cells. Many musculoskeletal tissues, including the CEP, cartilage-bone interface of articular joints, entheses, tendons, and ligaments, have components with very short T2 values (much less than 1 msec), which are orders of magnitude shorter than that of the nucleus of the disk (\~100 msec). In a conventional pulse sequence, such as proton density-weighted spin-echo (SE) or fast SE, with standard clinical section profile, the minimum echo time (TE) is typically 10 msec, which is much longer than that needed to capture the short-lived signal from these tissues. Recently, ultrashort echo sequence UTE technology has been introduced, and the TE time can be as low as 0.008ms. This range of TE is sufficient to capture signals from the cartilage endplate before it decays. With using new MRI technology, such as IR-UTE, UTE-MT, UTE-T2\*mapping, Maigc, DTI, and IVIM, which can quantitative tissues that have previously been ""invisible"" at conventional MR imaging, and provide imaging basis for early diagnosis of injury at molecular level.

NCT02090699,"Cardiac failure is the major cause of death in patients with thalassemia and chronic blood transfusion-related iron overload. The treatment of thalassemia has been revolutionized over the past decade with the implementation of cardiac MRI based assessment of iron overload. This has enabled detection of cardiac iron overload prior to symptomatic heart failure and now allows for timely therapy which has resulted in a substantial decrease in mortality. However, currently implemented MR imaging techniques assess for iron content only and not for iron related diffuse fibrosis which play a role in iron related heart failure. Histopathologic studies indicate that patients with iron overload have diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Quantitative MR techniques have shown that patients with various cardiomyopathies demonstrate diffuse myocardial fibrosis and that these changes correlate with changes in cardiac function. The investigators propose that quantitative cardiac MRI for assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis can further improve our ability to detect early damage to the myocardium and prevent morbidity and mortality from cardiac iron overload. Detection of fibrosis in patients with thalassemia may allow for earlier identification of cardiomyopathy when compared to other techniques in clinical use including T2\* analysis. Identification of fibrosis could affect patient management as it would allow for tailoring of iron chelation therapy and may lead to better understanding of the disease processes contributing to heart failure and arrhythmia in these patients.",['iron chelation therapy'],['']

Advanced H\&N cancer which has come back after treatment or has spread to other parts of the body is incurable and the average life expectancy of these patients is less than a year.

It may be possible to make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective by combining drugs that work in different ways. In effect, attacking the cancer from different angles. Cetuximab is a well-established drug that works by blocking signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide into more cells. It also engages with the immune system within the tumour.

All studies reported a significantly and clinically relevant improved OS(Overall Survival) or PFS(Period Free Survival) for adding locally ablative therapy to standard of care systemic therapy. However, these studies included only very few NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patients with activating driver mutations and the benefit of adding upfront local radiotherapy might be smaller or larger in this NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patient population with activating driver mutations and treatment with TKIs(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) smaller because of the higher systemic efficacy of TKIs(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) compared to chemotherapy or larger because the benefit of local treatment might become most obvious if potential microscopic disease is successfully controlled by TKI(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor)s .Consequently, there is a clinical need to evaluate locally ablative therapy in oligometastatic EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) -mutant NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patients and simultaneously a strong rational that this population might benefit in particular from a combined modality treatment: the benefit of locally ablative therapy is expected to be largest in situations of effective systemic therapies to control locally untreated microscopic disease which is true for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) targeting.

The investigator therefore propose a prospective two-arm phase II study, which aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of lazertinib combined with early locally ablative radiotherapy of all cancer sites in patients with synchronous oligometastatic (primary tumour and maximum 5 metastases) EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) -mutant (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) NSCLC.

NCT00509496,"Background:

* Human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been engineered to express a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a blood type, human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A\*0201) derived from the gp100 protein. A retroviral vector was constructed that can deliver the TCR to cells.
* This gene-engineered cell is over 10 times more reactive with melanoma cells than is the melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1) TCR that resulted in tumor shrinkage for two patients with metastatic melanoma.

Objectives:

* To determine whether an anti-melanoma protein receptor can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused, with the purpose of shrinking tumors.
* To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment.

Eligibility:

* Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).
* Patient's leukocyte antigen type is HLA-A\*0201.

Design:

-Patients undergo the following procedures:

* Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory, and the anti-gp100 protein is inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.
* Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously, IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.
* Treatment with anti-gp100. Patients receive an IV infusion of the treated cells containing anti-gp100 protein, followed by infusions of a drug called IL-2 (aldesleukin), which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.
* Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.
* Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).
* Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests, such as CT scans, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.
* Patients have blood tests at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years.","['IL-2', 'aldesleukin']","['', 'aldesleukin']"

According to World Health Organization (2016), more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight (39% of men and 40% of women).Regular exercise is the key contributor to energy expenditure and is essential for energy balance and weight control. Interval training (IT) has been commonly used for decades with purpose to improve body health and reduce weight loss and this exercise differs from the conventional aerobic exercise and endurance exercise as IT typically involves repeated bouts of relatively intense exercise interspersed by periods of lower- intensity effort or complete rest for recovery. One of the most common type of IT is sprint interval training (SIT). SIT involves 'supramaximal' effort (\>100% VO2max) work bouts, traditionally structured as four to six 30s all-out effort and each round separated by 4 minutes of recovery period of a low intensity exercise. Potential physiological adaptation of SIT are highlighted by various studies reporting cardiovascular, skeletal muscle adaptations, increase fat oxidation that facilitate increases in both aerobic and anaerobic performance. In addition, SIT is able to improve maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max), at the same time improving the peripheral vascular structure and function, enzymes of fat metabolism and increases insulin sensitivity. Previous SIT studies have included young healthy men and women, healthy obese young women, all of which have shown that SIT is effective for fat loss and improvement of some health parameters. However, whether SIT protocol is equally effective in improving the anthropometric measures in men and women remain unknown.",[],[]

NCT01271816,"Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited condition characterized by life threatening heart racing, presenting with palpitations, cardiac arrest (collapse requiring an ambulance) or sudden death. The disease affects the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. ARVC is diagnosed with a wide range of tests that focus on the pumping function and the electrical signals from the right ventricle. These factors are summarized in a score that forms the ARVC Task Force Criteria. Genetic testing has identified 5 different genes that lead to ARVC, which are detected in about 60% of patients with ARVC. This allows doctors to test family members of the patient with ARVC to determine if they are at risk of developing the condition. Currently, family members undergo testing that includes imaging and electrical tests such as a 24-hour monitor to determine if they have evidence of ARVC. With increasing frequency, family members are found to have the gene that may lead to ARVC, but little or no evidence that their hearts are affected. This may be because the family member is too young to develop the condition, or that other factors that we do not understand have protected them from developing it.

The PREPARE study will study 100 patients that carry a gene that can lead to ARVC, but do not have anything more than minor evidence that the condition is present. These patients will not have heart racing on their initial 24-hour monitor. These patients will undergo long term monitoring with an implanted heart monitor that is inserted with a minor surgical procedure, which will detect abnormal heart rhythms that may provide a clue that heart racing from ARVC is present that is not detected with a 24-hour monitor that is performed on an annual basis (St. Jude Confirm implantable loop recorder). These patients will be enrolled in 10 adult and pediatric centers across Canada, and followed for 3 years after their heart monitor is implanted. If heart racing is detected, patients will discuss these results with their doctor to discuss what it means to them.",[],[]

NCT01431040,"Preoperative bowel preparation for surgical management of pelvic floor disorders is performed inconsistently, and includes no prep, the use of dietary changes or bowel altering interventions. Retrospective studies of emergency colonic surgery first demonstrated a low rate of infectious complications without a bowel prep. Recently, data supporting the routine use of mechanical cleansing for elective colorectal surgery has demonstrated the surgical outcomes are similar between patients that undergo a bowel preparation versus those that do not, indicating that the long held dogma of mechanical bowel preparation should be used selectively. Despite routine use, there is a paucity of literature addressing the approach to, and/or need for preoperative bowel management at the time of vaginal reconstructive or obliterative surgery. The majority of the pelvic floor disorder population is older, tending to have more bowel dysfunction (especially symptoms of constipation) than younger women.

The aim of this study is to evaluate preoperative bowel management strategy as it relates to the total care of the vaginal surgery patients' intra-and post-operative bowel function and overall patient experience. Two commonly used pre-operative bowel prep strategies: no preoperative bowel prep versus clear fluids and 2-enema prep. The aim is to assess the value of bowel preparation or diet change in vaginal surgery, both from the physician's and patient's point of view. In this pilot study, subjects are randomized to either a clear liquid diet the day prior to surgery with 2 enemas and nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight, or NPO after midnight without any dietary changes or enemas.

NCT00972309,"Background:

* PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a protein found on normal and cancerous prostate cells. Levels of this protein are used to identify men who are at risk for prostate cancer and to monitor responses to treatment in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
* Research has shown that men who continue to have an elevated PSA level following primary treatment for prostate cancer are at increased risk for cancer progression. Studies have shown that the change in PSA levels over time, or PSA doubling time (PSADT), can be accurate in predicting how quickly the cancer is likely to progress. Individuals with a PSADT of less than 3 months are at extremely high risk for disease progression and death from prostate cancer. Individuals with a PSADT of greater than 15 months have a very low risk of death from prostate cancer.
* T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is a protein that is found in about 95% of prostate cancers and is known to stimulate the immune system. The TARP prostate cancer vaccine is made from pieces of the TARP protein called peptides and includes peptides that have been modified to make them more effective at stimulating immunity. Although these TARP peptides have been shown to stimulate the immune systems of mice, information is needed to determine if they also stimulate the immune system in humans. Since it is unclear what is the best way to give peptide vaccines, the TARP peptides will be given with substances known to stimulate the immune system or in a vaccine made with the patient s own cells.

Objectives:

* To determine the immune systems response to vaccination with TARP peptides.
* To determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide vaccination.
* To determine if vaccination with the TARP prostate cancer vaccine can slow down PSADT in men with an intermediate PSADT of 3 to 15 months.

Eligibility:

* Males 18 years of age and older who have completed their primary treatment for prostate cancer, have stage D0 disease, are Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A\*0201 positive and who have a PSADT greater than 3 and less than 15 months.

Design:

* Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:
* Arm A will receive the TARP vaccine with other substances that stimulate the immune system.
* Arm B will receive the TARP vaccine that includes a patients own white blood cells.
* First week of study, after screening for eligibility has been completed:
* Day 1: Apheresis procedure to extract white blood cells to test the immune response to the vaccine.
* Day 3: Flu vaccine to allow researchers to determine how well a patients immune system is working.
* Clinic visits in Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for physical examination, blood samples, and administration of the TARP peptide vaccine.
* Physical examination and blood samples only in Weeks 18 and 36.

NCT05046938,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of online group motivational interviewing (MI) on eating behavior, healthy lifestyle behaviors and quality of life in nursing participants with food addiction at three state universities in Ankara. The population of the research will be those who meet the diagnostic criteria for food addiction according to the Yale Food Addiction Scale. The research sample size was calculated with the G\* Power package program. As a result of the power analysis, a total of 52 participants, 26 for the intervention group and 26 for the control group, were found sufficient for the sample with 90% power, 5% margin of error and 0.2065 effect size. Considering that the number of participants would decrease during the research process, the number of samples was increased by 10% to a total of 58 university participants, 29 of which were interventions and 29 were controls. Among the participants who meet the food addiction criteria, the participants who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the research will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups (n1=29; n2=29). After these participants are stratified according to the change (pre-contemplation and contemplation stage) phase, a simple random assignment process within the strata will be done by an independent researcher to avoid selection bias. Random assignment will be done through a simple random numbers table. The independent researcher who does not know which group is the intervention group and which group is the control group will collect the data. Data collection tools will be applied to the participants in the intervention and control groups in the pre-MI session, the post-MI session, and 2 months later in the follow-up session.

NCT05514262,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect on pain and satisfaction during the administration of Covid-19 vaccination of two different non-pharmacological methods: squeezing a stress ball and placing Buzzy® on the injection site.

The research was planned with a prospective, randomized controlled and experimental design. Data collection will take place at the Covid-19 Vaccination Clinic of the Health Research and Application Center of Bursa Uludağ University. The research sample will consist of individuals who on the date of the beginning of the data collection stage asked for or approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination for themselves from the Turkish Ministry of Health, and who agreed to participate in the research.

The size of the study sample was statistically determined with the program G\*Power 3.1.7. As a result of power analysis, the total minimum sample width was calculated as 120 people, with 40 in each group, accepting type I error level as 5% and in order to achieve an 80% power level. Individuals who meet the research criteria will be assigned to the implementation and control groups by means of a randomization list created by computer according to age and gender.

Research data will be collected face to face, using an Individual Description Form, a Visual Comparison Scale and a Visual Individual Satisfaction Scale.

The following interventions will be performed on the individuals in the intervention group in addition to the standard vaccination procedure:

Covid-19 vaccination procedure with individuals in the stress ball group: With this group, a yellow stress ball will be used which is 6cm in diameter, of medium hardness and made of high quality silicone, and which returns to its original shape after being squeezed. The researcher will explain to the individuals in the group how they should use the stress ball five minutes before beginning the vaccination and during the procedure. The individuals will be taught to take the stress ball in their right hand, the side on which the vaccination will not be given, and, counting from one to three, to squeeze and release the ball, continuing until the procedure is finished. It will be explained that during the procedure, they should give their attention to the stress ball and focus on squeezing it.

Covid-19 vaccination procedure with individuals in the Buzzy® group: Individuals in this group will use the Buzzy® device. Before the vaccination procedure, the researcher will place the Buzzy® device, which will be at room temperature, on the vaccination site, and it will vibrate in a non-discomforting way for one minute. After this, the Buzzy® device will be removed from the site, and the nurse will perform the vaccination. Because Buzzy® is a device which can be re-used, it will be disinfected after each vaccination procedure, and re-used with other individuals. The Buzzy® device also has ice wings which will not be used in this study, and only the body of the device will be used to provide vibration.

Covid-19 vaccination procedure with individuals in the control group: Individuals included in the control group will receive no intervention before the vaccination procedure, and the routine Covid-19 vaccination procedure will be used.

Immediately after the administration of the vaccination, an assistant researcher who is unaware of the injection method used will ask individuals from all groups to assess their pain levels with the Visual Comparison Scale and their satisfaction with the procedure by means of the Visual Individual Satisfaction Scale, and the scores will be recorded on the data collection forms.",['Pfizer-BioNTech'],['']

NCT04127942,"Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) involves the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding structure, causing problems including myofascial pain and joint degeneration. TMD is mostly seen in the age group of 18 to 44. TMD treatment includes conservative (non-surgical) and surgical treatment. Surgical TMD treatment has a decent success rate but requires general anesthesia, hospital stay and surgical incision. There are also some risks of facial nerve and vascular damage, infection, puncture to middle cranial fossa. Conservative treatments include medication , physical therapy, use of occlusal splint, hyaluronic acid (HA) or Botulinum toxin injection and concentrated glucose solution. However, those managements lack the evidence from large placebo-controlled clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel non-surgical treatment is important and of great potential. The ultrasound guidance provides visualization of the lesion site, allowing the operator to provide injection precisely and avoid damage on adjacent tissue, nerves and vessels. it is not only convenient and economic, but also associated with significantly less radiation exposure than conventional techniques such as computer tomography or fluoroscopy. Using ultrasound guidance in injective TMD treatment can increase successful rate and prevent unnecessary side effects. While current available evidences suggest the promising effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection therapy in treating TMD, publication of study with strict design is still lacking. Therefore, this study is a randomized, controlled and double-blind design, which aimed to access the efficacy of ultrasound-guided PRP injection therapy of TMD, with normal saline used as control.

NCT05591287,"Contrast enhanced harmonic Endoscopic Ultrasound (CH-EUS) can be used during a conventional EUS examination to correctly identify and target lesions with the help of Ultrasound Contrast Agents. When CH-EUS is applied to the dynamic ultrasound images of conventional EUS, additional information about tumour vascularity can be obtained solely from the visual uptake of contrast agent into the tumour. Angiogenesis within malignant tumour tissue is varied from that of its normal surrounding tissue.Blood flow within malignant tissue is characteristically low volume. Contrast agents are slow to pass through tumour microvasculature and hence this is seen as an area of hypo-enhancement. This hypo-enhancement or hypo-vascularity is well demonstrated in PDAC and the opposite is known to be true for PNET, both of these findings showing to be consistent with cytopathological results.Tumour hemodynamics and vascular patterns resultant from contrast uptake can be analysed further with the help of fractal use. Attaining this information can allow more accurate characterization of both PDAC and PNET thus in turn predicting their respective behaviours i.e., aggressiveness (local or systemic spread) and histological grade. (6)

Contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) is currently used to evaluate the response of chemotherapy in patients with PDAC according to the RECIST guidelines. However, one significant advantage of CH-EUS over dynamic CT imaging is that ultrasound contrast agents do not leak into the interstitial space allowing for better quantitative measurement of tissue perfusion.More recently, the EFSUMB guidelines have recommended dynamic CH-EUS as a preferred technique to monitor anti-angiogenic treatment.This founds the basis for evaluating CH-EUS's role. \*(with the help of fractal analysis)-remove this if needed\* in predicting PDAC's response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy as this is yet to be evaluated.

NCT01500252,"Background:

Despite the excellent results of total knee replacement, also known as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) there is persistent controversy over whether or not to replace the surface of the kneecap. Anterior knee pain, which occurs with variable and unpredictable frequency, continues to be a problem in a subset of TKA patients. Some clinicians replace the surface of all kneecaps during TKA to avoid repeat surgery, which occurs in approximately 10% of cases. However, others cite the complications attributed to replacing the surface of kneecap as reasons to avoid this procedure.

This study prospectively randomized patients receiving TKA into two groups, those receiving replacement of the kneecap surface and those left without replacement of the kneecap surface to determine clinical outcomes and revisions over the first 5-10 postoperative years.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this work was to compare pain, stiffness and function between groups at five years postoperatively. Secondarily, we compared pain, stiffness and function at one and 10 years postoperatively. Finally, we examined the number of reoperations following TKR over 10 years in the 2 groups of subjects. The investigators hypothesized that there would be no difference between the two groups of subjects in the measured outcomes.

Methods:

Patients receiving TKA were prospectively enrolled before surgery and randomized intraoperatively to either receive a replacement of the kneecap surface or have no kneecap intervention. The Smith and Nephew Profix TKA system was implanted in all cases; the post-operative regimen was standardized. Subjects were assessed pre-operatively and at 1 and 5 years postoperatively for pain, function, and stiffness using a disease-specific (Western Ontario and MacMaster Osteoarthritis Index \[WOMAC\]) and generic health status (Short Form 36 \[SF-36\]) questionnaire. At the end of the five year follow-up, the study was extended to a 10-year followup and the same outcomes were assessed. The revision rate was also compared between the two groups at the end of the 10-year follow-up.",['Smith and Nephew Profix TKA system'],['']

NCT02307097,"The efficacy of high-intensity Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder is well established (Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014) and it is recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as the first-line psychological intervention for social anxiety disorder. The treatment aims to modify several maintenance factors (e.g., self-focused attention) that are specified in cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (e.g., Clark \& Wells, 1995).

Cognitive-behavioural self-help treatments for social anxiety disorder have been developed to overcome various accessibility issues (e.g., long wait-lists, and the patient's need to avoid social situations, etc) associated with high-intensity CBT (Abramowitz et al., 2009; Carlbring et al., 2007) but a recent network meta-analysis (Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014) identified the former as less cost-effective than the later and thus, they are not recommended as standalone treatments.

However, the potential benefit of cognitive-behavioural self-help treatments for social anxiety disorder within a stepped-care recovery model as a prelude to high-intensity CBT has not been formally evaluated.

The aim of this study is to evaluate a seminal Cognitive-Behavioural Bibliotherapy\* (CBB; ""pure self-help"" book) - 'Overcoming Social Anxiety \& Shyness' (Butler, 2009) - for patients with social anxiety disorder while on the wait-list for high-intensity CBT within an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, and to determine if some patients recover from CBB alone or whether there may be a reduction in the average number of high-intensity CBT sessions for those patients who subsequently require further treatment.

NCT06253390,"The peripartum period is the period between the last month of pregnancy and up to a year after childbirth. It can be considered a difficult time for women, as it is a period of transition during which vulnerability to psychiatric disorders and in particular to major depressive disorder (MDD) (Vesga-Lopez, Blanco, Olfson, Grant \& Hasin, 2008). Depression with peripartum onset (PPD) is characterised by the fact that the onset of symptoms may occur during pregnancy or within four weeks of delivery, but may also persist for up to 12 months after delivery (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). PPD affects 10 to 20% of women who have given birth (Tebeka et al. 2021). In addition, the psychological distress experienced by the mother during the peripartum period can disrupt interactions with her newborn (Lefkovics et al. 2014). Depression during this period can therefore have long-term consequences, not only for the women who suffer it, but also for their children (Gavin et al. 2005).

The investigators now know that women with PPD have deficits in metacognition. Metacognition is the body of knowledge, processes and practices that enable individuals to control and evaluate their own cognitive activities, thereby enabling them to regulate them (Flavell, 1976). Patients with PPD therefore have difficulty identifying, controlling and evaluating their own cognitive activities. These deficits may also represent a risk factor for the development of PPD if they are present at an early stage (Diop et al. 2022).

In patients with PPD, metacognitive therapies appear to be effective in reducing symptoms. In 2013, Bevan, Wittkowski and Wells conducted a pilot study to test the effects associated with metacognitive therapy in depression. This was the first published study to evaluate the effects of metacognitive therapy on patients with depression in the peripartum period. It shows promising results which it would be interesting to replicate, as this is a pilot study. A metacognitive training program for depression (D-MCT) was developed by Jelinek, Hauschildt, Moritz and Dubreucq in 2016, it is a brief group intervention that is easy to manage to participants. To date, no study has yet tested this specific program in patients with PPD, but it has been able to show its effectiveness in reducing the metacognitive deficits.

In the light of the scientific literature, the aims of this study are, firstly, to demonstrate the efficacy of D-MCT therapy in subjects with post-partum depression. Secondly, to examine the effects of this therapy on mother-child interactions.

The investigators make the following assumptions:

* Women in the experimental group showed a greater reduction in depressive symptoms and an improvement in metacognitive functioning than those in the control group.
* Women in the experimental group showed a reduction in depressive symptoms after therapy (v2) and maintenance of this improvement (v3).
* Improvement in the quality of mother-child bonding for women who took part in the program compared with those in the control group.

NCT04339660,"The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, especially the critically ill cases.

NCT04031105,"Priming stimulation is a highly promising tool to boost the beneficial effects of therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in psychiatry. The potentiating effects of priming stimulation, however, depend on the time interval between the priming and the test stimulation. Although it is known that too short and too long intervals have no effects, systematic studies that identify the time needed to maximize efficacy have not yet been done. Thus, there is a need for studies to investigate the effects of priming stimulation in order to fully utilize the potential benefits and advantages of this promising new rTMS protocol. This study will systematically investigate the neuromodulatory process underlying priming stimulation to enhance metaplasticity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) - one of the main targets for therapeutic rTMS - in individuals with subclinical depression.

The brain is a highly plastic organ and its activity can be influenced using rTMS. At the same time, the brain also has a mechanism - called homeostatic metaplasticity - which counteracts extreme plastic changes. Homeostatic metaplasticity therefore can limit the beneficial effects of brain stimulation interventions. However, priming stimulation protocols that include both a priming and a test stimulation session may utilize homeostatic metaplasticity to increase the beneficial effects of brain stimulation, although the optimal treatment parameters for priming are not known. Moreover, little is known about homeostatic metaplasticity in the DLPFC, an area that is particularly relevant for psychiatric conditions given its role in the top-down control of emotions. Here, the investigators will systematically study metaplasticity using priming theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a potent form of rTMS in the left DLPFC. Changes in blood oxygenation that signal brain activity changes will be assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) at rest and during engagement in several cognitive tasks. The findings from this study will (1) elucidate the optimal time interval between priming and test stimulation; (2) elucidate the influence of priming TBS on emotion discrimination as well as executive function and its underlying brain activity in subclinical depression; and (3) validate homeostatic metaplasticity in the left DLPFC.","['priming stimulation', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'rTMS', 'ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'Lipitor']","['', '', '', 'ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '']"
NCT04719182,"Rationale Many patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) need hospital admission for oxygen supplementation. A substantial number of patients need intensive care unit (ICU) admission for escalation of care. ICU doctors and nurses are struggling to provide the best care for patients with COVID-19. Practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments remains uncertain.

Objective To determine and compare practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments for COVID-19 in the Netherlands, and to determine their independent associations with outcome.

Hypotheses Practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments for COVID-19 varies substantially. Adjunctive and supportive treatments have an independent association with outcome in ICU patients with COVID-19.

Study design National/international, multicenter, retrospective observational study. Study population Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19.

Methods In this study we will collect data on diverse treatments during the first 28 days in ICU, including (a) the types of oxygen support\* and awake prone positioning; (b) the types of ventilatory support, (c) rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia during invasive ventilation (prone positioning, ventilator adjustments, continuous muscle paralysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation); (d) adjunctive treatments, including thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulation, antiviral and immunomodulating therapies, and (e) experimental supportive treatments. Outcomes include duration of each adjunctive treatment, duration of ventilation, incidence of tracheostomy, duration of stay in ICU and mortality until day 90.

Study endpoints A combination of adjunctive treatments, including types of oxygen support, ventilatory support and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia during invasive ventilation (primary), other adjunctive and supportive treatments, tracheostomy rate; duration of ventilation and ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 (VFD-28), duration of ICU and hospital stay, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality.

- Previous studies have suggested that smoking cigarettes affects the number of receptors in the brain for nicotine, a chemical present in cigarette smoke. The receptors play a role in an individual's ability to think and concentrate. Many people with schizophrenia and similar disorders smoke, and research suggests that smoking may temporarily improve concentration and focus in individuals with schizophrenia. Researchers are interested in studying both current smokers and nonsmokers with schizophrenia to determine whether smoking affects the number of nicotine receptors in the brains of people with schizophrenia.

Objectives:

- To study the distribution and volume of nicotine receptors in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia who are either nonsmokers or current smokers.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and are either nonsmokers or current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for the past year).
* Current smokers must be able to give up smoking for 48 hours.

Design:

* This study involves an initial screening visit and up to five study visits.
* After the screening visit, participants will have two sessions in which they will complete questionnaires about thoughts, memory, and smoking habits. Smokers will also have nicotine blood and carbon monoxide breath levels taken during these sessions, before and after smoking a cigarette.
* Participants will have sessions with imaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) to provide baseline measurements for later tests, and will also have tests to measure brain electrical activity.
* Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning session to examine the nicotine receptors in the brain.

   1. Objectives:

      This study evaluates whether strict BP management is useful for the prevention of recurrent stroke.

      Hypertensive patients with history of stroke are treated with stepwise multi-drug therapy to achieve stricter BP target \<120/80 mmHg in the strict BP control group and less stricter BP target \<140/90 mmHg or \<130/80 mmHg for patients with current DM/CKD/MI in the standard BP control group. The participants under the BP treatment achieving their respective BP target will be followed for recurrence of stroke. The study continues until the number of patients with the first recurrent stroke reaches a total of 330 between the two groups. The occurrence rates of recurrent stroke will be compared between the two groups.
   2. Hypotheses The incidence of recurrent stroke will be lower in a strict BP control group having lower BP target: \<120/80 mmHg\* than in a standard BP control group having BP target \<140/90 mmHg or \<130/80 mmHg for current DM/CKD/MI in patients with hypertension.

NCT05430750,"Environmental hazards of human activity are a topic of present day world, global warming being one of the leading concerns. Gases that contribute to this are greenhouse gases. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas that is commonly used in medical practice, mostly confined to provision of anaesthesia during surgical procedures in the operation theatre. N2O is not a potent anesthetic, and is used as a carrier for volatile anesthetic during general anaesthesia. This is to reduce the use of volatile anesthetics and other analgesic drugs while maintaining adequate depth of anaesthesia and analgesia. The N2O gas that is used during general anaesthesia is scavenged and released into the atmosphere without any processing. In the atmosphere it stays and produces deleterious greenhouse effect primarily owing to its long lifetime of 114 years. In addition, it also causes depletion of ozone layer. The green house effect of gases is evaluated and compared with the use of carbon-di-oxide equivalents (CDE). When the effects are considered for 20 years it is termed CDE20.The efforts to reduce these harmful effects can be directed towards reduction/cessation of N2O use, or its post anesthetic processing. The long history of its use in clinical practice and benefits such as analgesia for various procedures; makes it difficult to be completely taken out of usage in the present day anaesthesia practice. Though processing of N2O after use during GA is possible, it's impractical because of cost efficiency. We therefore, have directed our focus on further reducing its consumption while being used for GA. Low- flow anaesthesia has been in practice for the same reason (i.e. to reduce the wastage of gases).

This study is aimed to reduce the N2O consumption even further by employing a novel 'streamed-in' technique of N2O administration during low-flow GA. Conventionally, N2O use is initiated during the initial high fresh gas flows (FGF) before shifting to low-flow ventilation. 'Streamed-in' N2O administration strategy employs initiation of N2O into FGF after the institution of low-flow anaesthesia. Hence, the participants are not exposed to an unconventional drug or a new route of its administration, but an alternate strategy to its conventional use. We aim to evaluate the novel technique of 'streamed-in' N2O during sevoflurane GA for its global warming effects (in terms of CDE20) and its clinical effects ( intraoperative general anaesthesia state, hemodynamic profile) and post operative effects( postoperative nausea vomiting -PONV, postoperative pain profile- numerical rating scale-NRS)","['Nitrous oxide', 'Sevoflurane']","['nitrous oxide', 'sevoflurane']"

Participants will undergo apheresis-a method for collecting larger quantities of certain blood components than can safely be collected through a simple blood draw-by one of the following two methods:

* Automated pheresis - Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and spun in a machine, separating the blood components. The white cells are extracted and the red cells, with or without plasma (liquid part of the blood), are re-infused into the donor through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to prevent blood from clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting during processing.
* Manual pheresis - One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein, similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells, with or without plasma, are separated from the rest of the blood and re-infused to the donor through the same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic, for example, may fall into this category.

Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease and immune function and for HLA testing, a genetic test of markers of the immune system.

In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, cohorts of 4-6 patients will be treated at each dose level and 10 additional patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to confirm safety. The busulfan dosing will begin at 1 mg/kg based on historical plasma levels obtained from patients receiving BU at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg at UCSF Medical Center.

The highest dose level proposed for this study will exceed the reported toxic level for busulfan in the alloSCT setting. Patients will be followed closely for toxicity and strict stopping rules have been included. Eligibility criteria will exclude patients with prior history of hepatotoxicity or viral hepatitis. Potential hepatotoxic agents will not be allowed just prior to and during the busulfan dosing period. In addition, patients who experience hepatotoxicty during pre-transplant mobilization therapy may be excluded from receiving dose-escalated busulfan therapy.

NCT01524042,"Recently colonoscopy has gained importance as screening programs for colon polyp, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease in the United States and other countries. The number of colonoscopy performed has been increased year by year. To make an increased compliance with colonoscopy in both screening and clinical surveillance programs, consideration of anxiety, shame and satisfaction in examinee is regarded to be important. During colonoscopy patients wear conventional single pants where there is no hole for insertion of scope. Patients take off the conventional single pants below the buttocks and expose their buttocks and perianal area during colonoscopy. Exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy can make patients feel shameful and anxious and diminish satisfaction of colonoscopy. Recently considering the factors affecting satisfaction has been regarded to be important because patient satisfaction could be one of the quality indicators for colonoscopy. To diminish shame and anxiety by exposing perianal and perineal area of patients wearing conventional single pants during colonoscopy, we developed novel double pants with a hole in inner pants. Novel double pants are composed of double fabrics from hip to thigh and single fabric under the thigh such as common pants. In the inner pants of double pants, there is a hole for insertion of scope. The hole is 25 cm wide and 15 cm long. The outer pants are same as conventional single pants. If the patients dropped outer pants below hips, only hip and perianal area are exposed through the hole (25cm\*15 cm) for insertion of scope without dropping inner pants. Therefore novel double pants minimized the exposed area of hips than conventional single pants because hips are exposed only the hole of inner pants. Smaller exposed area of hips by novel double pants can minimized the shame and anxiety by diminishing exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy. Therefore advantage of novel double pants is decreasing shame and anxiety and increasing satisfaction by minimizing the exposed area of perianal and perineal area compared with conventional single pants. This study is a randomized controlled study.

NCT00943748,"Few available drugs can slow the progression of neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One of the recent hypotheses concerning the reduction of oxidative stress and neuron death features a harmful effect of iron, which may reach abnormally high levels in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (iron overload has been seen in the substantia nigra in parkinsonian patients and in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD). Iron overload is harmful because it reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced during the oxidative deamination of dopamine, generating hydroxyl radicals which then damage proteins, DNA and phospholipid membranes and may be responsible for neuron death. The use of an iron chelator (clioquinol) produces a reduction in neuron death in the MPTP mouse model. In humans, a special, partially refocused interleaved multiple echo (PRIME) MR sequence has been used to study the relaxation time (T2\*) and quantify iron overload in the SN of PD patients and the nucleus dentatus of patients with Friedreich's ataxia. T2\* sequences have revealed a decrease in iron overload following treatment with the chelator deferiprone, in parallel with a clinical improvement in these patients. Furthermore, the very recent open label use of deferiprone in rare serious, systemic, neurological iron overload diseases (Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA)) has revealed a clinical improvement after 6 months, with 2 case reports from our group and another from an Italian group (Forni et al., 2008). The safety of the low dosages of deferiprone (20 to 30 mg/kg/day) used in neurology appears to be much greater than for the high dosages (75 to 100 mg/kg/day in 3 doses) used in hematology to decrease post-transfusion iron overloads in thalassemia major.

Hence, the investigators wish to evaluate the effect of treatment with an oral iron chelator which is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (deferiprone) on iron overload in the SN(as assessed by the T2\* sequence) with respect to the progression of clinical sign in PD. It is expected a 6-month course of deferiprone able to produce a moderate reduction in iron overload of the SN, associated with a drop in the motor handicap score. Depending on the risk/benefit balance determined in this initial pilot study, a larger, multicenter neuroprotection study could be envisaged.","['clioquinol', 'deferiprone']","['clioquinol', 'deferiprone']"
NCT02338401,"Resting metabolic rate (RMR) declines by 1-2% per decade after 20 years of age. This reduction is linked to a decrease in fat free mass (FFM) (10-20%) and the rate of energy expenditure of tissues (Manini 2010).

It has also been shown that as we age there is a:

* Concomitant reduction in basal fat and carbohydrate oxidation, most likely due to the decrease in RMR than to a change in respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (St-Onge and Gallagher 2010).
* A change towards a more saturated membrane of different tissues (Rabini et al 2002).

Incorporation of omega-3s, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), into cell membranes may alter energy metabolism by:

* Increasing the rate at which proteins operate (Hulbert 2007).
* Promoting the release of EPA and DHA into the cytosol which will act as ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (Calder 2011). PPARs play an important role in energy homeostasis by regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism (Kota et al 2005).
* Augmenting protein synthesis through activation of the mTOR-p70s6k pathway (Di Girolamo et al 2014).

Supplementation with fish oil in older males and females:

* Increases whole muscle phospholipid profile of EPA and DHA (Smith et al 2011).
* Increases lean body mass (LBM), RMR, and fatty acid oxidation (Logan et al unpublished)
* Decreases carbohydrate oxidation (Logan et al unplubished). Skeletal muscle (SM) accounts for 20-30% of RMR (Zurlo et al 1990, Manini 2010), therefore it is tempting to speculate that these changes may occur by some of the mechanisms described earlier, with skeletal muscle being an important contributor.

To date there are no studies that have examined the effect of n-3 supplementation (3g/day)\* on plasma membrane fatty acid composition, RMR and substrate oxidation, and the possible mechanisms behind it.

Therefore the purpose of this study is to determine whether in older adults (female and male), supplementation with n-3 alters:

NCT00935298,"Acute rejection (AR) is the main complication after transplantation, which is a severe risk of chronic rejection and implant devitalization.

Tacrolimus (FK506) is an immunosuppressant used for the prevention of episodes of acute rejection. Tacrolimus is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and important interindividual variations of its pharmacokinetic characteristics.

Tacrolimus is metabolized through the liver by the cytochrome P450 system, the cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP 3A5) isoenzyme specifically. Polymorphisms in the CYP 3A5 gene have been associated with changes in metabolic function of the translated isoenzyme. These polymorphisms result in metabolism acceleration of tacrolimus as compared to subjects having the wild type gene, consequently leading to insufficiency of tacrolimus; it is theorized that this leads to higher risk of acute rejection. Several retrospective studies suggested an association between a genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5 and the interindividual variations of tacrolimus blood concentration. In particular, our initial study showed that adult renal transplant recipients with the CYP3A5\*1/\*3 and \*1/\*1 （expressors） genotype require higher, fixed, starting dose compared with CYP3A5\*3/\*3 （nonexpressor）to reach the predefined target exposure early after transplantation.

This prospective study is designed to evaluate whether genetic testing of CYP 3A5 can improve tacrolimus initiation better than usual care. This study is a prospective, multicentric, open, parallel , efficacy study. 300 receivers of a renal transplant in 8 centres will be included.

The genotyping of gene CYP3A5 will be carried out in the 4-7days before renal transplantation. After transplantation, the patients will be treated by MMF, corticosteroids and tacrolimus at a dosage adapted to their genotype(0.15mg/kg/d for CYP3A5\*1/\*1 type and CYP3A5\*1/\*3 type，0.08mg/kg/d for CYP3A5\*3/\*3 type).

The determination of tacrolimus blood concentration will be carried out on Day 3,5,7,14,18,21,28,35,49,63,77,90. The daily amounts of tacrolimus could be modified if necessary to reach the desired blood concentrations. The total duration of the study for a patient is 3 months after transplantation.

NCT03303287,"Pakistan is a developing country and there have been a considerable rise in obesity and hypertension in children in recent years. In this setting a focus on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases is more cost effective than spending resources on secondary or tertiary prevention,. Primary prevention includes interventions to promote physical activity (\> 30 minutes/day in school), healthy dietary habits (decreased consumption of sweetened beverages and snacks, and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables) and health education focusing on cardiovascular risk factors in school children. This would translate into healthier cardiovascular outcomes (eg. less hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes) in adult life.

The patients with confirmed diagnoses of CRC (site code C18.0-20.9 and C26.0) between 2004 and 2013 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Due to the significant disparity in the number of cancer survivors with various prior cancer types among newly diagnosed CRC patients, the investigators utilized the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition (ICD-O-3) Site Recode to identify 10 common previous cancer sites, including the colorectum, prostate, breast, uterus, bladder, skin, lung, kidney, thyroid, and stomach. CRC patients with a prior history of cancer originated from one of the 10 sites and surgical CRC patients without a prior history of cancer were enrolled in this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients with more than one cancer in the past; (2) The patient's age at diagnosis was \<18 years old; (3) Patients with incomplete survival data and follow-up information; (4) Patients only had autopsy or death certificate records.

The primary outcomes of this study were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to date of death（patients who were still alive at the end of follow-up were considered as censored data. CSS was defined as the time from diagnosis to date of death caused by CRC (patients who deaths from other causes or still alive at the end of follow-up were considered as censored data). The investigators set December 31, 2018, as the cut-off date for follow-up to ensure that all included cases (diagnosed in 2004-2013) were followed for at least 5 years.

Based on prior cancer history, the surgical cases were categorized into two groups: 'Non-prior cancer history' and 'Prior cancer history.' The 'Prior cancer history' group was further subcategorized by the type of prior cancer, including colorectum, prostate, breast, uterus, bladder, skin, lung, kidney, thyroid and stomach. The bias between different Prior cancer history group and Non-prior cancer history group was minimized by Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to compare OS and CSS differences. And then, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was performed to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to analyze whether different types of prior cancer history impacted the OS and CSS in patients who underwent surgery for spCRC independently. Common demographic and clinicopathological data, including age at diagnosis of spCRC, sex, race, marital status, tumor location of spCRC, pathologic grade of spCRC, TNM stage of spCRC (0-I, II-III, IV and unknown) and chemotherapy status were entered as covariates. Kaplan-Meier curves were also constructed according to the time since first cancer diagnosis (latency), age diagnosed with spCRC, and spCRC stage.

Further analysis was performed to determine the impact of surgery on survival of spCRC patients with different type of prior cancer history. The investigators divided patients into surgical and non-surgical groups based on whether surgery was performed, and then assessed the effect of surgery on survival using the propensity score-adjusted Kaplan-Meier method.

In this study, the baseline characteristics of patients were compared using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. A one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the selection bias of the two groups of baseline variables. When performing one-to-one propensity score matching between the prior cancer history group and the non-prior cancer history group, the investigators chose a caliper of 0.2. However, the investigators opted for different calipers when matching the surgical and non-surgical groups because the investigators believe that patients with different prior cancers were in entirely different situations. A two-sided probability value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. R software (version 4.2.3) was used for all statistical analysis.",[],[]

NCT01502592,"This study is being done to evaluate the safety of two strategies called ""cryoablation"" and ""immune therapy"" in women with curable early stage breast cancer. ""Cryoablation"" is a procedure performed by an expert doctor called a radiologist. The radiologist uses (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to insert a needle directly into a cancer. Very cold temperatures are then applied through the needle to kill the cancer cells. Some of the killed cancer cells will be broken into pieces that can be recognized by a person's immune system.

The ""immune therapy"" in this study is a drug called ipilimumab. Normally the immune system makes ""T cells"" that can kill cancer cells when turned on. The cancer-killing T cell activity is controlled by a molecule called CTLA4. Ipilimumab works by turning off CTLA4. Turning off CTLA4 allows the cancer-fighting T cells to remain active Ipilimumab is an antibody drug has been made in a laboratory for patient use and was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma. An antibody is a normal protein that the immune system uses to find and kill germs like bacteria and viruses. This study is being done because the researchers believe that when cryoablation is combined with immune therapy, a person's immune system can be trained to recognize that person's cancer. This may prevent that cancer from coming back in the future. In other words, it is hoped that by adding cryoablation with ipilimumab before the mastectomy, the body will remain cancer free long after the mastectomy is performed.

NCT00954200,"Scientific background: Bronchoscopy is a procedure commonly performed in the management of persistent respiratory illness. In the last decades this exam has become a routine and safe procedure even in children and there are few side-effects. However, one known side effect is transient fever and even high fever a few hours after the bronchoscopy. This side effect is not dangerous but very uncomfortable for the patients and it would be interesting to try to reduce this phenomena. This fever is due to a release of cytokines during the broncho-alveolar lavage procedure and not to sepsis. In a previous study a single dose of dexamethasone was shown to prevent the fever post bronchoscopy with no apparent detriment to the child. It is well known that steroids are immunosuppressive. Even though the post-bronchoscopy fever is not caused by an infection, it seems preferable to use other anti-inflammatory drugs to fight this very inconvenient side effect.

Ibuprofen (Nurofen\*) is known as an effective medication to reduce fever in infectious illnesses and is even considered as superior to paracetamol. It has no immunosuppressive effect and is usually well tolerated by children with very few side effects when taken in the normal therapeutic dose of 10mg/Kg.

NCT02874079,"Autoimmune bullous dermatoses include pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis, linear IgA dermatosis, mucous membrane pemphigoid, lichen planus pemphigoid, anti-p200 pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and dermatitis herpetiformis. Autoimmune bullous dermatoses are rare and have an incidence of 20-60 new cases per 1 million person- year in Europe. The incidence of the individual entities is slight significantly different within Europe, but strongly also in comparison to other countries such as Kuwait, Singapore, USA and South America. The most common of these disorders is the bullous pemphigoid.

A considerable progress has been made in the last years to elucidate the pathogenic role of autoantibodies in these diseases. To this end, various in vitro and animal experiments have been used to understand some basic pathophysiological mechanisms in these diseases. Further studies are currently being carried out to explain a precise elucidation of the disease process and to be able to treat the patients targeted later.

At present, however, no data are available to explain why certain individuals develop the autoimmune disease and others do not. Epidemiological studies showed some triggers to the development of autoimmune dysregulation, e.g. drugs.

Furthermore, it has been shown that genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. A clear association with certain HLA regions have been shown in patients with pemphigus, e.g. about 95% of pemphigus patients from the group of Ashkenazi Jews have the HLA-DRB1\*0402 haplotype. Recently, the first non-HLA gene associated with pemphigus was described. For other conditions such as bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis or linear IgA dermatosis the association with HLA antigens is less pronounced. Another indication of the importance of the genetic background in these diseases can be elucidated from the observation of autoantibodies at a low concentration in healthy relatives of pemphigus patients.","['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'Lipitor']","['ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '']"

Objective:

To test higher or lower doses of belinostat based on gene variants in people with HGNEC.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with HGNEC.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Some blood will be used for genetic testing. They will have imaging scans and a test of their heart function. Samples of tumor tissue may be collected.

NCT03656549,"Rationale:

Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted folate antagonist, which is primarily indicated for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. Dosing of cytotoxic agents like pemetrexed requires balancing the dual risk of sub-therapy and toxicity. Administration of pemetrexed to patients with a creatinine clearance \<45 ml/min is currently not advised. Pemetrexed is dosed based on body surface area (BSA), while renal function and dose are the sole determinants for systemic exposure. This causes 3 major issues:

1. In patients with renal dysfunction, BSA-based dosing may lead to haematological toxicity
2. Patients have to discontinue treatment due to declining renal function, and are withheld effective treatment
3. Even in patients with adequate renal function (GFR \>45 ml/min) treatment may be improved by individualized dosing based on renal function, resulting in less toxicity. Also, BSA-based dosing may lead to ineffective therapy in patients with above average renal function.

The investigators aim to address these problems.

Objective: The overall main objective is to develop a safe and effective individualized dosing regimen for pemetrexed.

Study design:IMPROVE-I is a single arm phase II pharmacokinetic safety study using a Simon two stage design to assess the feasibility of renal function-based dosing of pemetrexed in renal impaired patients.

Study population: IMPROVE-I includes 23 patients with NSCLC or mesothelioma with an estimated creatinine clearance \<45ml/min that meet all other requirements for pemetrexed treatment.

Intervention:Patients will be treated with pemetrexed, with dosing based on renal function. As a safety measure, the first dose will be calculated to 50% exposure. After administration, safety and pharmacokinetics are assessed. If tolerated well, dose escalation to reach 100% exposure is performed, including assessment of safety and pharmacokinetics.

Main study endpoints: The fraction (percentage) of patients with attainment of therapeutic exposure.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

The investigators consider the extra burden from participating in the planned studies limited. The extra interventions compared to routine care, consist of sampling extra blood. The pharmacokinetic assessments require placement of one additional intravenous catheter. To ensure minimal impact of study participation on daily life, a limited sampling strategy will be used. Patients may benefit from participating in IMPROVE I and -II, as they will be treated with a potentially safe and effective drug that is dosed individually, which prevents toxic exposure",['Pemetrexed'],['pemetrexed']

NCT00952159,"Many methods to detect CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have been validated. Some of them are based on phenotyping (metabolism of dextromethorphan or debrisoquine) and some others on genotyping. Up to now, CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics has been restricted to the field of research, in spite of poor metabolizer profile concerns 5 to 10 % of caucasian population. Nevertheless, the polymorphism of CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, particularly of two opioids involved in pain management: codeine and tramadol, their metabolites representing the most effective part of the drug effect. So prescribing codeine or tramadol in a patient poor metabolizer for the CYP2D6 is likely to be ineffective in pain management.

O-demethyl-tramadol, the metabolite of tramadol via CYP2D6, is important to consider because its analgesic effect is 2 to 4 times more potent than tramadol.

The investigators propose to phenotype CYP2D6 in post-operative patients treated by tramadol by monitoring seric concentrations of O-demethyl tramadol and tramadol to make a ratio in comparison with genotype, and to find a threshold to determine poor metabolizers. As already described, genotyping CYP2D6 will use a rapid detection method of the alleles implicated in poor metabolizer status (CYP2D6\*3, \*4, \*5 et \*6) in a Caucasian population. Sampling will be executed at two times (H24 and H48 after surgery) and only with blood (three EDTA tubes) during the post-operative monitoring of the patients. This study is likely to include 320 post-operative patients treated with intravenous tramadol during one year in three university hospitals centers (CHU of Caen, Creteil and Rouen).

The first aim of this study is the validation of monitoring seric concentrations of O-demethyl-tramadol and tramadol to make the ratio in order to detect CYP2D6 poor metabolizers in therapeutic situation, comparing the result with genotyping. The finding of a poor metabolizer status in a patient will make the choice of analgesic drugs easier, avoiding tramadol and codeine. The final objective of this research is to be able to determine the CYP2D6 phenotype in a patient treated by tramadol without a good analgesia. By a single take of blood and a rapid response, this method should be liked to improve pain management. Furthermore, CYP2D6 phenotyping is interesting for the patient because many other drugs depend on this way of metabolism.","['dextromethorphan', 'debrisoquine', 'codeine', 'tramadol', 'O-demethyl-tramadol']","['dextromethorphan', 'debrisoquine', 'codeine', 'tramadol', '']"

NCT05379569,"Comparing the efficacy and safety of fludarabine-containing BFC conditioning regimen with traditional BuCy conditioning regimen in Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients who treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to establish a conditioning regimen for improving the survival rate of patients with B-cell ALL after transplantation.

Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematologic malignancy . The incidence of B-All is higher in children than in adults, but more than 80% of children patients can be cured by chemotherapy, while the survival rate of adult patients is less than 40%. Recurrence or progression of the disease is the main reason affecting the survival of patients.

Although CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy is an effective salvage treatment for relapsed and refractory B-ALL, bridging allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required after remission. 1-year LFS and 1-year OS were 11.6% and 32% in patients without bridging grafts after CAR T.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for ALL. Before the transplant, patients receive high doses of chemotherapy plus or total body irradiation（TBI） to 'creation of space' ，immunosuppression and disease eradication. This is called conditioning regimen. Conditioning regimen plays a key role in reducing tumor load and diseaseconditioning regimen recurrence.

Conditioning regimen for different diseases are different. Conditioning regimen are based on TBI and chemotherapy BuCy, with low TBI recurrence rate but high treatment-related mortality (TRM). BuCY chemotherapy had low TRM but high recurrence rate, so there was no difference in total OS. Therefore, it is of great clinical value to explore a conditioning regimenprogram. How to optimize the preconditioning program before transplantation, so as to reduce the recurrence rate and prolong the survival period of adult B-cell ALL patients after transplantation has become a issue that needs to be solved urgently in clinical practice.

BFC (Malilane + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide) is the addition of fludarabine to BuCy (malilane + cyclophosphamide). The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide has synergistic effect, which can better kill B lymphocyte, and can enhance the killing effect of pretreatment regimen on B lymphocyte tumor.","['fludarabine', 'BuCy', 'Malilane', 'cyclophosphamide', 'CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy']","['tamatinib', '', '', 'cyclophosphamide', '']"

NCT05404100,"Background: Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the commonest valve disease. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is primarily indicated when symptoms occur and/or when there is a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction. However, irreversible myocardial damage, such as replacement fibrosis, leads to increased morbidity and mortality despite treatment. Improved patient selection and timely treatment is thus warranted. T1 mapping, a non-invasive method to quantify myocardial fibrosis by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), could be a marker to guide treatment.

Aims: To investigate the change of myocardial fibrosis\* in AS patients following AVR and if these changes are associated with disease and/or procedural characteristics.

Methods: This is an observational clinical trial. Approximately 60 patients with severe AS planned to undergo AVR (either surgical or transcatheter) at Rigshospitalet, Denmark will be included. Participants will undergo CMR before surgery and at a 1-year follow-up. Other assessments include clinical evaluation and blood sampling. The primary end-point is change in T1 values after AVR.

Hypotheses and perspectives: The investigators hypothesize that (1) myocardial fibrosis\* will regress in patients undergoing AVR as a group, (2) the degree of myocardial fibrosis is positively correlated with the degree of symptoms, (3) the regression of myocardial fibrosis is greater in patients undergoing TAVR compared to SAVR, and (4) the regression of myocardial fibrosis is greater in patients with tricuspid aortic stenosis compared to bicuspid aortic stenosis. Ultimately, T1 mapping is a potential marker for improved patient selection for the timing of AVR.

NCT06131346,"Anti-IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder associated with antibodies to IgLON5, a neuronal cell adhesion protein of unknown function. Most patients develop a combination of significant sleep disturbances (non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement parasomnias with obstructive sleep apnoea), bulbar dysfunction (dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis or episodes of respiratory failure) and gait instability. Early autopsy studies showed deposits of phosphorylated tau protein mainly in neurons of the brainstem tegmentum, suggesting a primary neurodegenerative disease. However, the results of subsequent studies have provided increasing support for an immune-mediated pathogenesis. First, there is a strong association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DRB1\*10:01-DQB1\*05 : 01, which is present in \~60% of patients (compared to 2% in the normal population); secondly, recent autopsy studies have shown the absence of abnormal tau deposits; and thirdly, in live neurons in culture, IgLON5 antibodies cause irreversible loss of surface IgLON5 clusters and cytoskeletal changes such as dystrophic neurites and axonal bulges. Together, these studies suggest that antibody-mediated disruption of IgLON5 function leads to neurofilament and cytoskeletal alterations that can potentially result in tau accumulation.

Over the last two years, an increase in diagnoses of anti-IgLON5 disease has been observed in the French Reference centre of Autoimmune Encephalitis. This could be related to a better knowledge of the disease, or to other yet unknown factors.

NCT06292117,"The goal of this observational study is to use a genetic test to help doctors prescribe the most effective medications after a patient has a stroke. One type of stroke is caused by a blood clot in brain vessels. After a patient has this kind of stroke, they are often given a combination of two blood thinners to prevent it from happening again. One of these blood thinners, called clopidogrel, is less effective in some people due to differences in their DNA. Clopidogrel needs to be activated by a specific enzyme in the body known as CYP2C19. This enzyme does not work as well if there are variations in the section of DNA that tells the body how to make CYP2C19. It can be predicted who has less CYP2C19 enzyme activity with a genetic test. If these patients are given a different blood thinner, it can reduce their risk of another stroke compared to if they are given clopidogrel.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* What are the best strategies to implement this genetic test in the hospital?
* Does implementation of this genetic test change providers' decisions on which medication to prescribe after a participant has a stroke?

Participants in this study will have a genetic test done onsite looking for variations in the section of DNA that tells the body how to make CYP2C19. This genetic test will only look for 11 known variations; the genome will not be sequenced. The investigators will alert the doctor of the patient's test results so they can prescribe the appropriate blood thinner.

NCT04755153,"Hypertension affects 1 in every 3 adults in the US and contributes to 410,000 deaths annually. Hypertension and its associated complications disproportionately affect minority populations living in urban areas. In Chicago, health status indicators show worsening disparities between black and white residents, with the highest rates of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke clustering in the predominantly black South and West Sides. Kaiser Permanente demonstrated that a bundle of evidence-based interventions implemented within a large, integrated health system in Northern California significantly increased blood pressure control rates. However, it is unclear whether a health system centered intervention can be adapted to other settings, particularly under-resourced urban communities. Therefore, the overall goal is to support a community-centered design and adaptation of the Kaiser bundle. The investigative team will adapt the delivery model of the Kaiser bundle to be centered within churches within the South Side of Chicago, one of the most medically underserved communities in the United States. The proposed interventions are the same as in the Kaiser bundle (e.g., registry/audit and feedback, simplified treatment regimens, accurate Blood Pressure measurement) but implementation of the components of the bundle will be adapted for delivery in the community. The intervention will be carried out by local community health workers and ministry facilitators, with health clinics and hospitals in the community as support, all connected through a common data platform.

Thus, the proposed project will identify the best strategies to support adoption, implementation with fidelity, and sustainability of the Kaiser bundle in the community setting.

NCT05861401,"Introduction Alopecia areata (AA) is a complex inflammatory disease characterized by cellular infiltration of T- lymphocytes targeting hair follicles, disrupting the anagen phase, with spontaneous remission, recurrence, and exacerbation, making it very unpredictable and emotionally disturbing . It affects nearly 1-2% of the general population with a lifetime risk of 2%, The onset of AA might be at any age; however, most patients develop the disease before 40 years of age . Early-onset AA (a mean age of onset at 5-10 years) predominantly presents as a more severe subtype, such as alopecia universalis . Alopecia areata presents clinically as a non-scarring patchy hair loss primarily on the scalp, and/or other hairy areas and may progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis, AT ) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis, AU ) . Approximately 5- 10% of AA patients will progress into AT/AU . The course of AA varies greatly, the strongest predictors of a poor prognosis include AT, AU, or ophiasis pattern hair loss, as well as earlier age of onset . Severe and recurrent AA disturbs quality of life of patients and may also lead to depression, changed self-image,and interferes with social activities . Currently, the hypotheses for AA development mostly focus on the collapse of immune privilege properties of the hair follicles(HFs) and the nature of self-antigen presentation (follicular antigens) that result in the induction and subsequent attack of activated lymphocytes . Activation of the lymphocytes mainly CD8+NKG2D+induces release of severalTh1 cytokines; interleukin (IL)-1α , IL-1β , and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, capable of inhibiting (HF) growth with early termination of anagen . AA is a polygenic disorder in which several major genes dictate susceptibility to disease, up to 28% of patients report at least one affected family member, monozygotic twins have exhibited similar times of onset and patterns of hair loss.

Genes loci for Human leucocyte antigens (HLA)DRB1\* 1104 and DQB1\* 03 are detected in patients with AA. The Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT); (JAK/STAT) pathway play an important role in inflammatory processes as they are involved in signaling for over 50 cytokines and growth factors. The JAK/STAT pathway transduces multiple extracellular signals involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis .

The JAK family is constituted by four types of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases:

JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 . STAT, of which there are seven different subtypes (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6) (17), is the other fundamental component of the cascade . After being phosphorylated by JAK, STAT translocates to the nucleus to induce the transcription of specific genes. Alterations in the JAK/STAT pathway have been related to the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD), vitiligo, and AA.","['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'Lipitor', 'JAKs', 'Janus kinases', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription', 'JAK/STAT pathway', 'JAK1', 'JAK2', 'JAK3', 'TYK2', 'STAT1', 'STAT2', 'STAT3', 'STAT4', 'STAT5a', 'STAT5b', 'STAT6', 'atopic dermatitis', 'vitiligo']","['ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The two medications are commonly used and appear to be equally effective for other types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery. This study will show if one type of anesthesia is preferred over another by patients getting LASIK. Before your LASIK procedure, you will be given a short questionnaire to determine the baseline comfort of your eyes. In the operating room, one type of anesthetic will be put in one eye, and the other medication will be put in the other eye. Which anesthetic you get in each eye will be chosen in a random way (similar to flipping a coin). After your LASIK surgery, the investigators will ask you if you felt more comfort in your right eye, your left eye, or if they were equal, and the investigators will ask you the same survey questions that were asked prior to your LASIK to get more details about your experience.

NCT00604526,"High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a form of radiation treatment using temporary radioactive seeds. This is done by placing very tiny catheters or tubes into the prostate and then inserting temporary radioactive seeds, called Iridium 192, through these catheters. HDR brachytherapy gives precise radiation to the prostate with less radiation given to the normal tissues near the prostate. For patients who have been treated with external beam radiation to the prostate before, HDR brachytherapy can give radiation again to the prostate without exposing the normal tissues around the prostate to significantly more radiation. This may be safer than giving external beam radiation again.

NCT06319391,"Tacrolimus is the most commonly used immunosuppressant for preventing and treating rejection after liver transplantation. However, its treatment window is narrow, the pharmacokinetic individual differences are large, routine dose according to body weight, sometimes low dose will cause graft rejection of patients, or high dose will lead to infection and liver and kidney toxicity and other adverse reactions. Moreover, the conventional drug testing can not fully reflect the efficacy of tacrolimus, and there are shortcomings of lag, experience and passivity. FK506 is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 member 3A5 in the liver and intestines. CYP3A5\*3 is the most important factor determining the expression level of CYP3A5. This mutation can cause variable shear and produce unstable protein, so that patients carrying CYP3A5\*3/\*3 gene do not express CYP3A5. Acute kidney injury is a common and important complication after liver transplantation. Despite recent advances in organ preservation, surgical techniques, and immunosuppressive protocols, the incidence of AKI after orthotopic liver transplantation remains high. AKI has a significant impact on both short - and long-term prognosis of orthotopic liver transplantation recipients. Studies have shown that orthotopic liver transplantation recipients with AKI have significantly higher mortality rates in hospital, at 28 days and at 1 year after surgery than those without AKI.

NCT00080353,"This study will examine the effectiveness of treating advanced melanoma with special tumor-fighting cells taken from the patient's blood or tumor and grown in the laboratory. The cells are given along with infusions of a growth factor-like substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2) and an experimental vaccine called fowlpox gp100. This vaccine consists of a peptide (part of a protein) called gp100 that is often found in melanoma tumors and chicken virus (fowlpox) that has been altered so that it cannot produce illness in humans.

Patients 16 years of age and older with melanoma that has spread beyond the original site and that does not respond to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, and x-rays and scans to the evaluate the extent and size of the tumor. Because the experimental preparation is based on tissue type, only patients with tissue type HLA-A\*0201 may participate. Tissue type is determined by a blood test.

Participants undergo the following procedures:

* Leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting lymphocytes (white blood cells): Using this procedure, special cells with good tumor-fighting ability are selected and removed for later re-infusion into the patient. To collect the cells, blood is withdrawn through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a catheter into a cell-separating machine. The lymphocytes are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle. Alternatively, lymphocytes may also be collected from biopsied tumor tissue, obtained either with a needle or by a small cut in the tumor.
* G-CSF injections: This growth factor is injected under the skin every day for 5 days to stimulate white blood cell production.
* Catheter placement: Upon admission to the Clinical Center for treatment, the patient has a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein in the neck or arm for giving chemotherapy and other medicines, for infusing the lymphocytes, and for collecting blood samples.
* Leukapheresis: Repeated in the hospital to collect and store blood that may be needed in the rare event that the patient's blood components do not recover after chemotherapy.
* Chemotherapy: A week before the lymphocyte infusion, patients receive a 1-hour infusion of cyclophosphamide for 2 days and then a 15- to 30-minute infusion of fludarabine for 5 days to suppress the immune system and thereby prevent rejection of the infused lymphocytes.
* Vaccine and lymphocyte delivery: The vaccine is injected through the catheter, followed by a 30-minute infusion of the lymphocytes.
* IL-2 and G-CSF: Patients receive IL-2 infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion to help keep the cells alive, and G-CSF injections under the skin every day after the cell infusion until white cells increase to a sufficient number. The entire hospital stay is usually 12 to 16 days.

About 4 weeks after the lymphocyte infusion, patients are re-admitted to the hospital for about 10 days for a second vaccine injection and course of IL-2 infusions. Between 2 and 4 weeks after completing the full treatment regimen, patients return to NIH for evaluation. Those whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable may repeat the entire treatment regimen two times. Those whose tumors continued to grow may be re-treated with infusion of lymphocytes through an artery instead of a vein if their tumors receive blood from a major artery. If this is not feasible, or if it is tried without success, the patients will be taken off the study.","['interleukin-2', 'fowlpox gp100', 'cyclophosphamide', 'fludarabine']","['', '', 'cyclophosphamide', 'tamatinib']"

The prevalence of this metabolic disease among adults had been disclosed by the World health Organisation (WHO), reporting a total of 422 million diabetic adults and 3.7 million diabetic deaths in 2016, with Asian countries contributing more than 60% of the world's diabetic population. Due to its economic and social repercussions, preventive strategies are implemented at a population level. The implementation of a diet low in glycaemic index (GI) has been widely adopted as part of diabetes management strategies to prevent and control Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as the consumption of food with low GI has shown to improve glycaemic control, lipid profile, and reduce systemic inflammation.

A peripheral stem cell, bone marrow , or umbilical cord blood transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine together with methotrexate and methylprednisolone may stop this from happening.

NCT02696356,"This is a study of an investigational cancer vaccine called GRN-1201. Treatment with the GRN-1201 vaccine is a type of immunotherapy. The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate the body's immune system (white blood cells) to attack cancer cells and kill them. GRN-1201 consists of 4 different peptides (small parts of proteins) that are expressed by melanoma cells. The intent of treatment with GRN-1201 is to increase your body's immune response to melanoma.

To further increase your body's immune response against tumor cells, the GRN-1201 vaccine will be mixed with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF, also known as sargramostim). GM-CSF is a man-made protein that helps stimulate the immune system and increase the response against the tumor cells. This is a phase I study which means that this will be the first time GRN-1201 is given in combination with GM-CSF to humans.

NCT00767559,"The purpose of this research is to find a better way to prevent the post operative development of clots in the deep veins of the legs (also called Deep Vein Thrombosis or DVT). DVT causes redness, swelling, and pain in the involved leg(s). Long-term complications may include permanent swelling and pain of the leg(s), and even skin ulcers around the ankle. If clots form in a leg after surgery, and break off, they can move to the lungs and block the pulmonary artery (also called Pulmonary Emboli or PE). With PE there can be chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, heart failure, and occasionally death.

Doctors have studied ways to reduce these complications. These studies led to the development of drugs which interfere with your body's clotting processes. However, it is still unclear which drug and which drug schedule is best. This study will evaluate two of the standard FDA approved drugs using different dosing schedules.",['FDA approved drugs'],['']
NCT02256800,"Metastatic diseases were found in 20-25% of patients with initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer and developed in up to 50% of patients. Owing to limited post-treatment response of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with leucovorin (LV) obtained in mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer) patients, other therapeutic agents with different mechanisms were considered, such as irinotecan, a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I, which is involved in the unwinding of DNA during replication. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and was the first antiangiogenic agent approved for the treatment of cancer.

Infusional fluorouracil/leucovorin plus irinotecan-based regimen (FOLFIRI) with bevacizumab has been widely used as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Recently, the investigators have shown that prospective analysis of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotyping for irinotecan dose escalation (FOLFIRI regimen) with combination of bevacizumab biweekly as the first-line setting in mCRC patients (ASCO Abstract #491 - 2013 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium).

In this study, the investigators will enroll approximately 320 mCRC patients (It was considered that an increase of response rate of 15% compared to conventional irinotecan dose of 180 mg/m2, and these were chosen as parameters with which to calculate the study power. Initial power calculation was suggested that a minimum of 140 patients in each group would be required to achieve statistical significance with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level. It is estimated that about 10% of 320 mCRC patients fail to complete the study). For these enrolled patients, the investigators will randomize and divide these patients into two groups: control group and study group. Control group includes mCRC patients who will receive the conventional regimen of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Otherwise, patients in the study group will have genotyping of UGT1A1 before therapy, and dose escalating of irinotecan will depend on results of genotyping.","['5-fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', 'irinotecan', 'bevacizumab']","['fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', 'irinotecan', 'bevacizumab']"

NCT00555217,"Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. The overall rate of ESRD secondary to diabetes has risen 68% since 1992. Medications that block the renin angiotensin system have been shown to decrease the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The use of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to decrease the risk of progression of kidney disease in two studies of individuals with Type 2 diabetes and proteinuria. Despite the use of an ARB, the incidence of renal failure remained high in the treated group in both studies. The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and ARB can lead to more complete blockade of the renin angiotensin system. In diabetic kidney disease, combination therapy has been shown to decrease proteinuria in short-term studies. Although there are encouraging results for improvement in proteinuria there are no data on progression of kidney disease for the use of combination of ACEI and ARB therapy in patients with diabetes. In addition, there could be an increased risk of serious hyperkalemia in individuals with diabetes who receive combination ACEI and ARB. The investigators therefore propose a randomized double blind multi-center clinical trial to assess the effect of combination of ACEI and ARB in patients with diabetes and proteinuria on progression of kidney disease.","['renin angiotensin system blockers', 'angiotensin receptor blocker', 'ARB', 'angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor', 'ACEI']","['', '', '', '', '']"

NCT00973219,"Rationale:

Worldwide, approximately 400 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Chronic HBV infection increases the risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is highest in HBeAg positive patients with high HBV DNA levels, but still the relative risk remains 10 for HBeAg negative patients. Furthermore it has been shown that when HBsAg is cleared before cirrhosis has developed, the prognosis is excellent. Recently the investigators have shown that HBeAg negative patients with high HBV-DNA load and low baseline HBsAg levels had a significantly higher HBsAg clearance (positive predictive value of 85%) after combination therapy with peginterferon alfa2a (Peg-IFN) and adefovir.

Based on these results, a trial was designed to investigate whether combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue combined with PegIFN, could also provoke a high rate of HBsAg clearance in chronic hepatitis B patients with low (HBV DNA \<20,000 IU/mL) viral load.

Study design:

This is a three arm open-label prospective randomized controlled trial. 150 patients will be enrolled into the study after assessment of eligibility. All patients must have documented HBsAg positivity for longer than 6 months, HBeAg negativity, anti-HBe positivity, HBV DNA \< 20,000 IU/mL and ALT \< 5 \* upper limit of normal. Patients with a Child Pugh class B or C will be excluded. Group 1 will consist of patients treated with Peg-IFN and adefovir, group 2 will consist of patients treated with Peg-IFN and tenofovir and group 3 will consist of untreated controls. Patients in group 1 and 2 will receive medication for the period of one year. For enrolment into the study a liverbiopsy at time of enrolment is compulsory and is advisable at end of treatment (week 48).

Study population: The study population will consist of 150 patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus with low viral load and HBeAg negativity.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

The aim of this study is to investigate what proportion of HBeAg negative, inactive carriers of the hepatitis B virus with low (\< 20,000 IU/mL) load will lose HBsAg when treated with nucleot(s)ide analogue/Peg-IFN combination therapy.

In this study the investigators hypothesize that both treatment with peg-interferon and ADF or Peg-IFN and TDF in HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B patients with low HBV DNA viral load will induce a high rate of HBsAg loss, comparable to that in patients with high viral load after treatment with ADF and Peg-IFN.","['Peg-IFN', 'adefovir', 'tenofovir', 'nucleos(t)ide analogue', 'TDF']","['', 'tamatinib', 'tenofovir', '', '']"

If FDA concludes that the drug is safe and effective, FDA approves the drug. The company can then sell the drug, which the company does using ""trade name."" Only the drug company that developed the ""trade name"" drug is allowed to sell it. However, other drug companies can create their own version of the ""trade name"" drug, which usually happens after the patents for the ""trade name"" product run out. These drugs, often called ""generic drugs,"" potentially will be less expensive for the patient. In order to sell generic drugs, drug companies must show that their generic version is the same as the ""trade name"" drug in a number of ways. For example, they generally have to show that their product is intended to be used to treat the same diseases or conditions, that it has the same label, and that the product has the same active ingredient as the ""trade name"" drug. The generic company also has to show that generic product is ""bioequivalent"" to the trade name drug, meaning that the generic product gets to the part of the body where the drug works at the same rate that the trade name drug does. How to show how much drug gets to the part of the body where it works, and how fast, depends on the type of product the drug is.

However, there is a notable absence of phase III comparisons among the three agents and therefore no clear indication of the superiority of one AI over the others. Furthermore, there remains a distinct lack of predictive biomarkers of AI efficacy and toxicity to inform clinical decisions. The metabolic pathways of exemestane have recently been delineated and UGT2B17 is the most active hepatic gluconoryltransferase responsible for the glucuronidation of the crucial active exemestane metabolite, 17-dihydroxyexemestane. The UGT2B17\*2/\*2 deletion genotype is associated with markedly reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane in vitro and is found more commonly in Asians than Caucasians (60-70% vs less than 10%). Our research group recently demonstrated significant reduction in glucuronidation of vorinostat, a UGT2B17 substrate, with a trend towards improved clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in Asian breast cancer patients who were UGT2B17\*2 homozygotes treated with this compound. In-vivo studies correlating UGT2B17\*2 genotype with exemestane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are lacking. We hypothesize that individuals with UGT2B17\*2/\*2 genotype have reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane and therefore have increased exposure to the active drug, resulting in improved treatment efficacy. We propose a study of exemestane in hormone receptor positive post-menopausal advanced breast cancer patients with prospective correlation of treatment outcome by UGT2B17 genotype. The primary endpoint is the correlation of genotype (UGT2B17\*2/\*2 vs those with at least one wild-type variant) with clinical benefit rate, and secondary endpoints include its association with exemestane pharmacokinetics, progression-free survival, overall survival and musculoskeletal toxicities.","['aromatase inhibitors', 'exemestane', 'vorinostat']","['', 'exemestane', 'vorinostat']"

NCT05701319,"Limited data have been published on the management and outcome of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that involves the left main (LM) coronary artery. Little is known about different strategies and techniques of percutaneous revascularization and long-term outcomes of these patients. Beside scarcity of data, most studies represent outmoded experience not reflecting contemporary advances in stent technologies, with the introduction of newer generation thinner strut drug eluting stents (DES), bioresorbable polymers, and faster re-endothelization properties promoting vascular healing and endothelial repair.

NCT01798199,"Virtual environments and information communication technologies (ICT) offer large perspectives in the field of assistive care and rehabilitation.

As potentially endless, the scenarios and environment used using 3D can provide immersive social and interactive context for enjoyable and therapeutic exercises in the aging population. In addition it is also possible to use this type of serious game and scenario in very easy to use devices such as lap top or tablet.

Social exclusion has many causes, Apathy as one of the most common behavioural disturbances found in old adults populations alters significantly social and emotional interaction.

Even though, progress in VR has been made over the past year, the presence of such technology in daily living space is still at the embryonic stage.

The European e-Inclusion policy stresses the importance of ICT in improving the quality of life in potentially disadvantaged groups, including older people and persons.

The VERVE project is developing ICT tools to support the treatment of people who are at risk of social exclusion due to apathy associated with a disability.

As people aged and autonomy worsen fear for safety and comfortable means to maintain social and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) status are public health issues.

Moreover, even though older adults would like to perform some activities such as walking in the streets some are reluctant to go out of their homes as the external environment is perceived as potentially unsafe.

Apathy, the most common behavioural symptoms in aging population is characterized by symptoms of reduced initiation and responsiveness to environmental interactions. The syndrome of Apathy takes form of diminished goal-directed behaviour, characterised by emotional blunting, loss of initiative and loss of interest. Apathy along with the nosological characteristics of dementia induces impairment in autonomy level and therefore dependence as cognitive impairments worsened.

The importance of stimulation could be related to the concept of engagement defined as the act of being occupied or involved with an external stimulus. Engaging older person with or without Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in appropriate activities has been shown to yield beneficial HRQL effects such increasing positive emotion, improving cognition, functional autonomy and quality of life.

Accordingly, enriched environments with high definition virtual representation of cities and activities of interest have the potentials not only to encourage patients to get active in a safe and interactive environment but also to create access to enjoyable and stimulating settings for the more severe patients.

The VR setting from VERVE proposed personalised and populated environments available on two different, but interlinked hardware platforms: 1/: standard gaming set-up in the home, nursing home or day hospital therapy group; and 2/ mobile tracked internet devices (e.g.,IPad). The system will ensure maximum openness and dissemination by using 3D Web technologies.",[],[]

NCT05826782,"Infertility is defined as the inability to become pregnant despite 12 months of regular and unprotected intercourse. Male factors include defects in sperm concentration, morphology and motility, among which low sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) is one of the most common types of male infertility and affects approximately 40% of all cases.

It has become clear that protein defects in spermatozoa and semen can cause fertilization failure by affecting sperm motility, and it is necessary to define proteins and related pathways precisely because they have an important role in the treatment phase.

Increasing evidence shows that free oxygen radicals that occur as a result of oxidative stress (OS) play a very important role in the etiology of male infertility.

A systematic review including 29 studies (19 randomized clinical trials and 10 prospective studies) examined the effect of antioxidant food supplementation and reported a positive effect on baseline semen parameters, advanced sperm function, outcomes of assisted reproductive therapy, and live birth rate.

Conversely, few studies have failed to confirm any positive effect of antioxidant therapy and even report a negative effect on male fertility. Therefore, there is no clear consensus on the clinical efficacy of antioxidant therapy yet.

Since the pathogenesis has not yet been clearly demonstrated, treatments are not based on evidence, but based on clinical experience.

Our aim was to randomly divide infertile male patients who applied to our clinic with the complaint of infertility and found asthenozoospermia (restricted sperm motility) in their semen analysis into two arms and examine the effects of antioxidant food supplementation on sperm motility and proteomic structure with a placebo-comparative, prospective, double-blind study (LC-MS/MS). analysis) is to reveal the metabolic pathways that may lead to restriction of movement.

NCT04109300,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common disease in Canada, leading to significant morbidity as a result of remitting and relapsing intestinal inflammation. Currently, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists such as infliximab, make up 30% of the biologic agents available to individuals with IBD. There is a high risk of losing response or having a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab, necessitating treatment discontinuation. This is due, in part, to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADA formation can result in loss of response to therapy which may eliminate an intestine-saving therapy and increases their risk of progressing to surgical resection. There are few tools clinicians can implement to minimize the risk of ADA formation. The current approach is to add a second drug (known as combination therapy), specifically an immunomodulator (methotrexate or azathioprine), exposing the patient to additional medication-related risks, intensive monitoring with bi-weekly blood work and potential side effects including infection and malignancy.

Preliminary data from our group as well as others suggests that individuals who carry a variant in the class 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene (HLADQA1\*05A\>G, rs2097432) are more likely to form ADAs to infliximab. Pre-emptive screening for this variant may allow clinicians to more selectively use combination therapy, recommending it only in IBD patients at high risk of developing ADAs to infliximab. Additionally, this may result in fewer drug-associated adverse events.

With this project, we aim to explore the value of prospective HLADQA1\*05 screening (pharmacogenomic screening) in IBD patients being considered for treatment with infliximab and using the result to guide the application of combination therapy compared to IBD patients treated with infliximab (with or without a second agent) as per current practice. We will assess the incidence of infliximab ADA formation, as well as the incidence of infliximab loss of response, treatment discontinuation, and adverse drug events. Additionally, we will assess the time to each of these events.","['infliximab', 'methotrexate', 'azathioprine']","['infliximab', 'methotrexate', 'azathioprine']"

NCT01566903,"MR angiography (MRA) has become essential in the treatment of neurovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke - the first cause of disability in occidental countries, vascular malformations such as aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas and malformations, whose treatments are improving year after year.

MRA is an alternative to digital substracted angiography (DSA), circumventing th use of endovascular catheterism, irradiation and injection of iodinated contrast agent. Contrast-Enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) with gadolinium injection is currently the reference standard for vascular MR exploration but still presents many limitations inherent to the injection of contrast medium. Hence, the synchronization of the acquisition with bolus contrast injection limits the improvement of spatial and temporal resolutions and requires an accurate synchronization of the acquisition with the arrival of the bolus.

Moreover, the acquisition can be repeated as required as it does not require any contrast injection.

Besides, the increase in nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical cases, which would be secondary to gadolinium chelates injection, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency has restricted the use of CE-MRA. More than 500 cases were described to date in the world.

Its occurrence is currently estimated around 4 % for patients in terminal chronic renal insufficiency and its mortality around 30 %.

According to the recommendations of AFSSAPS from August, 2007, two gadolinium contrast agent (Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN \*, General Electric HealthCare and Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST \*, Bayer HealthCare) are contraindicated if the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 30 ml/mn.

Non-contrast enhanced MR angiography (NCE MRA) techniques have been proposed to provide complete and non-invasive investigation of the vasculature, thus offering patients with chronic renal insufficiency, as well as pregnant or nursing women a surrogate with no side effects.

Moreover, the use of high field (3T) MR imaging offers improved signal to noise ratio. Combined with the use of phased array coils and parallel imaging, new NCE MRA sequences can achieve juxta-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution and temporal resolution of about 50 ms close to those of cerebral DSA.

NCT04090905,"Background and purpose Post-operative AF (POAF) is considered a phenomenon rather than a definite diagnosis and the current clinical guidelines have no specific recommendations regarding its management. Few prospective studies have been performed in non-cardiac conditions and the consequences of POAF in patients without known heart disease are not well described. However, recent data suggest an association between POAF in relation to non-cardiac surgery and increased post-operative mortality and stroke. POAF in relation to abdominal surgery seems common (incidence: 8-18%); however, the true incidence is uncertain. The available studies are few, heterogeneous, and often methodologically inadequate. The study aims at reporting the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), and associated complications, in relation to abdominal surgery.

Material and methods Designed as a prospective, single-centre, cohort study of consecutive adult patients undergoing acute\* abdominal surgery at the Department of Abdominal Surgery at Bispebjerg Hospital. Patients who are pregnant or where follow-up is not possible will be excluded. Patients will be examined pre-operatively by ECG and signal processed surface ECG (wavECG). A subset of patients admitted to the Department in the time interval of 7 AM to 11 PM$, will be offered heart rhythm monitoring from admission and until discharge (preferably ≥72 hours post-operatively). Additional follow-up will be based on a review of patient charts at discharge and one# month postoperatively. The primary endpoint is the occurrence/recurrence of AF. The study will include 400-500 patients of which an estimated 2/3 will wear heart rhythm monitoring corresponding to 264-330 patients.

Perspective If more thorough heart rhythm monitoring of patients undergoing abdominal surgery leads to the identification of more patients with AF, routine continuous heart rhythm monitoring should be considered recommended in upcoming guidelines to prevent associated complications.

NCT05168124,"Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a distinct disease entity with an estimated prevalence of 0.3-0.7% and more common in women (3:1 ratio). It can be diagnosed according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2015 consensus definition using 3 major criteria and one of 2 minor criteria.

Diagnosis requires that the patient have the following three symptoms:

1. A substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities that persists for more than 6 months and is accompanied by fatigue, which is often profound, is of new or definite onset (not lifelong), is not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and is not substantially alleviated by rest,
2. Post-exertional malaise,\* and
3. Unrefreshing sleep\*

At least one of the two following manifestations is also required:

1. Cognitive impairment\* or
2. Orthostatic intolerance

Note\* Frequency and severity of symptoms should be assessed. The diagnosis of ME/CFS should be questioned if patients do not have these symptoms at least half of the time with moderate, substantial, or severe intensity.

Currently, individually tailored therapy with emphasis on cognitive behavioral therapy and graduated activity therapy is considered the therapy of first choice, although their effectiveness has been critically questioned in recent years. There are often frustrating treatment courses, a larger proportion of partial remissions, a significantly smaller proportion of full remissions and return to work.

The study aims to evaluate patients of the outpatient service for chronic fatigue at the Department of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, in the context of a group therapy for the treatment of CFS/ME in respect to the response to different, non-drug based therapeutic procedures and to gain knowledge about the effects of the therapy.

The study is a clinical comparative study of therapeutic procedures/interventions without the use of drugs or a medical product.

NCT02523833,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a syndrome with variable clinical presentation in which lung inflammation is caused by inhalation of specific organic antigens or low molecular weight particles in previously sensitized individuals. Systemic symptoms may or may not be present. Chronic HP represents the final stage of the disease, caused by prolonged exposure to a particular antigen, leading to pulmonary fibrosis. In chronic HP, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) commonly present a restrictive ventilatory pattern, with decreased diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO). Some patients can also have obstructive disorders with expiratory flow limitation, due to obstruction of the small airways typically caused by bronchiolar involvement in this pathology. However, PFTs are relatively insensitive for detecting small airway involvement when there is concomitant interstitial fibrosis. First, conventional PFTs may be normal in patients with small airway involvement, since they contribute to less than 30% of the total airway resistance. In addition, damage to the small airways in HP is generally occurring parallel to areas of focal fibrosis - even when small airways are involved, these regions can be completely ignored, since they are excluded from ventilation. In summary, traditional PFTs are not sufficiently sensitive to detect diffuse small airway involvement in these diseases. In these cases, other functional tests, such as forced oscillation technique (FOT) and high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest with expired studies, could be used for this purpose.

This will be a cross-sectional study, which will include the following evaluations in 28 patients with HP recruited from our clinic:

NCT03118258,"Every year, in France, 3 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 1 000 die each year. Recent studies highlighted regional, social and economical inequalities with respect to cervical cancer incidence.

In France, the pap-smear test is currently the reference test in order to screen for cervical cancer and neoplasia (CIN). Screening and treatment reduced the incidence and the mortality due to cervical cancer by half in the two last decades. That said, many women are still not reached by prevention programs, especially women living in precarious conditions. In 2013, Doctors of the World France estimated that almost 70% of women aged 25 to 65 years old visiting its medical facilities had never had of a pap-smear test.

The main study objectives are :

Primary objective

To compare the proportion of individuals with abnormal cytology across two screening strategies in order to determine which strategy detects a greater proportion of individuals with abnormal cytology.

These two strategies consist of a preventive consultation followed by:

1. Direct patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility ('Pap smear' study arm)
2. An invitation to perform a self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing followed by patient referral for Pap smear testing in a partner health facility if the HPV-HR test is positive\* ('self-collected vaginal swab for HPV-HR testing + Pap smear triage' study arm) \*A women who tests negative for HPV-HR can still be referred for further Pap smear testing, or can be referred for a gynaecological consultation for any other reason.

First of secondary objectives:

To evaluate the proportion of individuals who completed cervical cancer screening in each study arm in order to determine which strategy resulted in greater screening participation.

Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

NCT01066871,"Several people all over the world suffer from cartilage injuries in the knee. Symptoms include pain, joint swelling, and loss of function. Without repair, cartilage injury may ultimately lead to osteoarthritis (OA). Natural healing is poor, and to date treatment is available only for deep cartilage defects involving also the underlying bone. A promising candidate for drug treatment of cartilage injury is sprifermin (AS902330), a recombinant form of the human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18.

So far, the drug has been used in subjects with different stages of knee OA in two ongoing studies without emerging safety issues following single and multiple intra-articular injections of ascending doses. However, OA represents late-stage cartilage injury, where repair might be difficult due to diffuse damage, reduced responsiveness of the cartilage, and/or the involvement of other joint structures.

NCT01243970,"ECG changes during caesarean section are common. Incidence of ST depression on the ECG is up to 81% in some studies. Although this may indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the heart muscle (myocardial ischaemia) many other theories have been suggested including air entering the circulation from the placental bed, high heart rate, hormone or nervous system influences and spasm of the coronary blood supply. Perioperative ST depression often reflects an imbalance between heart muscle oxygen supply and demand. At the time of delivery, high heart rate is common and there is a further increase in the amount of blood the heart has to pump every minute due to blood coming back to the circulation from the placental bed. This increases oxygen demand and most ST changes are seen at the time of delivery or within 30 minutes. The clinical significance of these changes is much debated, and apart from a few case reports do not appear to be associated with poor heart muscle function or ischaemia (lack of oxygen supply). Management of the mother's blood pressure during caesarean section has changed greatly in recent years. Intermittent boluses of ephedrine, given when blood pressure is low, have been replaced with prevention of low blood pressure and phenylephrine has become the drug of choice. Ephedrine increases heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle and is likely to increase oxygen demand. Phenylephrine reduces heart rate while maintaining blood pressure which may result in a more favorable oxygen supply demand ratio.

The investigators aim to compare the incidence of ECG changes if the mother's blood pressure is maintained with phenylephrine as compared to ephedrine. To see if these ECG changes are associated with myocardial ischaemia, the investigators will perform troponin T analysis after delivery. Troponin T is a molecule released by ischaemic heart muscle.","['ephedrine', 'phenylephrine', 'troponin T']","['ephedrine', 'phenylephrine', '']"
NCT05901142,"Background and study aims:

Nine out of ten women experience some negative effects due to their disease or its treatment such as anxiety, depression, weight gain and low quality of life. Research shows that exercise may help women overcome some of these effects. The investigators also know that most women become physically inactive after cancer treatment. Therefore, The investigators feel it is important that women get into a routine of doing regular exercise before they start their cancer treatment, this is called prehabilitation. The investigators believe that prehabilitation might help to build confidence and help women to continue exercising after their cancer treatment.

The investigators are doing this study to find out if a remote (NHS Attend Anywhere), multimodal (aerobic, resistance and targeted exercise), behavioural change (Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), dyadic coping (the collective effort to dealing with the stress of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment), and wearable technology), multiphasic (pre- and post-surgery) intervention is feasible in the short time frame between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery (less than 31 days). The investigators would also like to find out whether it is feasible for women to begin an exercise rehabilitation programme two weeks after their operation. If successful, the results will potentially enable us in the future to tailor the support gievn to women to help them prepare and recover from breast cancer treatment.",[],[]

Surgical treatment is the last resort to manage the above-mentioned clinical manifestations of pelvic floor disorders except the subject is too frail to receive operation.

In order to improve the outcome of reconstructive pelvic surgery, reinforcement with synthetic mesh or biological material is the modern trend in pelvic repair. Unfortunately no prosthesis including synthetic or biological is ideal because vaginal erosion with mesh extrusion which is the subject of this protocol and other complications were reported continuously. As per the literature, the rate for mesh vaginal extrusion ranged between 2.4 and 17% when polypropylene which is the most popular synthetic material used for the mid-urethral sling or pelvic reconstructive surgery to date. The causes of this complication are still controversial which include rejection, poor quality of tissue, surgical artifact, material of mesh and etc.

A prospective controlled study for the investigation of the cause for mesh vaginal erosion was conducted and the results revealed evidences of immune reactivity after mesh implantation, albeit the evidence was not solid (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2004; 191(6): 1868-1874 ). As per the pilot study initially done by us to determine the biofilm-related-infection, we have found bacterial biofilm could adhere to surfaces and interfaces, i.e. bacteria located in the cells just beneath the contacting surfaces in the electron microscopic (EM) analysis. In addition, soon after bacteria infection, proteins in biofilm undergo conformational changes, making them immunogenic and triggers a typical inflammatory response leading to activation of the complement system. Thus, we plan to use CD (clusters of differentiation) antigens - 4, 8, 20, 25, 40, 68 and quantitative analysis of FoxP3 to determine the function of regulatory T cells in the immune response.

NCT02157480,"Prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide. Lifestyle remains the cornerstone treatment for patients with T2D who are often overweight and sedentary.

Physical activity improves glucose metabolism of patients with T2D : increased glucose utilization during acute muscle activity and improved insulin sensitivity after regular training. The molecular mechanism underlying the effects of exercise on glucose metabolism involves the glucose transporter GLUT-4 which is regulated by physical activity.

Several studies and meta-analysis have showed that physical activity reduces HbA1c by 0.6% on average. In addition, other data suggest a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through physical activity.

Recent recommendations for T2D management call for the practice of a structured type of endurance 150 minutes per week and muscle building 2 times per week. However, implementation of these recommendations is low, even when integrated into a therapeutic education program. Adherence is often transient and / or partial. In addition, many T2D subjects are unable to initiate a physical activity because of disabling complications or comorbidities or because of a major cardiorespiratory deconditioning.

Neuro-myo electrical stimulation (NMES) is a physical treatment routinely used in functional rehabilitation to improve muscle strength and volume. The metabolic effect of NMES has been little studied. A pilot study conducted by our team on a population of 18 subjects with T2D showed that a week of daily NMES sessions significantly improved insulin sensitivity of about 25% and up to 50 % for good responders. This result contrasted with the low induced energy expenditure by each 20-minute session of bi-quadricipital NMES, suggesting the possibility of a humoral or neural mechanism associated with NMES.

To complete this work, we plan a randomized cross-over trial with 3 periods (6 weeks without NMES (control), 6 weeks with 3 sessions of NMES per week and 6 weeks with 5 sessions of NMES per week) to assess the glucose profile of sedentary T2D subjects during these different periods. We hypothesize that the bi-quadricipital NMES could improve glycemic control in T2D subjects and thus represent an alternative to traditional physical activity.","['insulin', 'humoral', 'Lipitor']","['insulin human', '', '']"

NCT02676908,"Compression stockings are traditionally worn for a period of time after varicose vein surgery to reduce pain and bruising. The investigators provide an ambulatory endovenous ablation service. Patients come to the Veins Unit, receive oral sedation, have their veins treated with either laser or radiofrequency ablation plus phlebectomies\* under local anaesthetic, recover for an hour and then go home. \*Phlebectomy describes the technique of pulling out small varicose veins through small incisions in the overlying skin. The standard practice of the Veins Unit is to advise patients to wear class two compression stockings for four weeks post-operatively. Many patients would prefer a shorter period of time in stockings.

The Nice Guidelines for Varicose Veins has posed the question: 'How long should stockings be worn for after endovenous ablation?'

Three trials have addressed this issue:

Bakker looked at patients who wore stockings for either two or seven days after laser ablation only; the group who wore stockings for seven days fared better.

Elderman looked at patients who either wore no stockings or stockings for two weeks after laser ablation only; the group who wore stockings for two weeks had less pain.

Krasznai looked at patients who wore stockings for either 4 hours or 72 hours after radiofrequency ablation only; there was no significant difference in post-op pain among groups.

None of these trials included patients who had phlebectomies at the same time. This study aims to answer the question 'How long is it necessary to wear compression stockings for after endovenous ablation (either laser or radiofrequency) plus concomitant phlebectomies?'

Post-operatively at home, all patients will be asked to keep a diary of pain and analgesia use. They will also document bruising at seven days on charts and on a visual scale. At their four week clinic review, all patients will be asked to fill out a pain and bruising score, a bruising chart and the two short quality of life questionnaires again.

NCT01555684,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that often results in reduced muscle function which produces fatigue, weakness and a decline in daily mobility. Although the underlying cause of the disease is unknown a possible contributory mechanism is chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). Post-mortem studies and magnetic resonance venography have shown a strong relationship between the cerebral venous system and MS cortical plaques. From this a role for CCSVI in MS has been suggested: venous malformations that result in venous hypertension, pressure on the blood brain barrier and subsequent inflammation due to leakage of haemosiderin into the parenchyma. This provokes an immune response which results in neurodegeneration. A procedure known as percutaneous venoplasty whereupon a balloon is inserted and inflated into the jugular vein has been developed to improve this drainage of the CNS, reduce venous hypertension and improve symptoms associated with MS. Although this procedure is widely practiced throughout the world it has yet to be fully accepted as it needs to be supported by evidence based clinical trials. As such NHS National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently issued a consultation document to determine more about the procedure's clinical safety and efficacy. A common concern raised is the ability to prevent any possible placebo effect and like any other clinical trial should offer a sham procedure to a matched control group. The difficulty with this option are the ethical issues associated with an invasive sham treatment and also the practical issues of masking a potentially painful treatment such as venoplasty. One option is to have blinded neurological assessment of patients who have either been treated with venoplasty or had no active treatment. Another option is to use dependent measures that are unaffected by motivational or psychological influences which avoids any placebo effect issue. One such dependent measure is motor unit firing behaviour whilst contracting at a submaximal target force. Typically clinicians have used this to manage motor disorder patients but have used cumbersome invasive technology that can only measure a few motor units with limited accuracy. However, De Luca et al recently developed a high density surface electromyographic (HDsEMG) system that can measure 30-40 motor units with 92-97% accuracy. From this it has been proposed as a highly effective tool for evaluating efficacy of therapeutic interventions for upper motoneuron disorders such as MS.

Accordingly the investigators propose to use a repeated measures design on an experimental (receiving venoplasty) and control (not receiving venoplasty) MS groups (6 patients in each group) to determine the effect of the treatment on muscular function, mobility and fatigue. This would be combined with independent blinded neurological assessment of the two groups of patients.

This design enables us to achieve two aims:

1. Acute neuromuscular response to the treatment
2. Chronic response to the treatment (6 weeks) to determine the effect on muscular function, mobility and fatigue.\*

Methods

* Four (first two to establish baseline variability of measures) repeat visits to the laboratory at University of Stirling to establish neuromuscular measures:

NCT01541878,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women. It is the second leading cause of cancer related death in women in many parts of the world. Breast cancer also occurs in men, accounting for nearly 1% of the total incidence. As a result of continuing research into new treatment methods, women and men with breast cancer now have more treatment options, and a better chance of long-term survival than ever before.

The primary treatment for breast cancer is surgery. Early stage breast cancer, defined for the purposes of this registry as newly diagnosed, clinical stage I to IV breast cancer with no prior therapy for current disease, is often curable with surgery alone. Reports from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) longitudinal trials have explored the efficacy of various surgical techniques as primary treatment of early stage breast cancer1-7. These studies include 20 years of follow-up data that have not shown any significant differences in overall survival or in rates of distant recurrences in women who underwent breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy versus those who underwent mastectomy. The results of these studies have supported the use of surgery as the standard breast cancer treatment practice around the world.

Data have shown that regardless of the surgical procedure selected for the removal of the primary tumor, micrometastases may be present and lead to the development of disease relapse. In order to decrease the risk of recurrence, patients may receive various therapies. Systemic treatments include chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Local treatment, such as radiotherapy, can also be used to eliminate malignant cells that remain in the breast, chest wall, or lymph nodes after surgery.

The selection of systemic therapy is a complex process, which is based partly on prognostic factors such as lymph node status, and predictive factors such as hormone receptor status. A number of additional factors are emerging such as HER2/neu overexpression8-10, p53 status, histological evidence of vascular invasion, and quantitative parameters of angiogenesis, but these await confirmation by further research11. However, patient age, socioeconomic status, and availability of treatment options are among a number of other factors that may play a role in determining the type of therapy that a patient is offered.

Over the years, results from a large number of clinical trials have led to the development of various guidelines for breast cancer therapy, including the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Group (EBCTG) conferences in 199512 and 200013, the 2000 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference14, and the 8th St Gallen meeting in 200315. Despite the overview analyses and consensus recommendations, detailed information is lacking regarding the actual use of the currently available breast cancer treatments. Furthermore, the reasons that patients and physicians choose specific therapeutic regimens are not well understood.

With more than 1.2 million people worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer in 200116, and the incidence predicted to increase, making appropriate treatment choices is critical to each breast cancer patient's survival, well-being and quality of life. The plethora of available scientific and lay information can result in a complex and arduous decision-making process for the breast cancer patient and his/her health care provider(s). It is anticipated that this registry will assist in the decision-making process by providing up-to-date information about treatment patterns.

STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study is to collect, analyze, and disseminate data on patients with stage I-IV breast cancer. The goal of this registry is to improve patients care through a better understanding of treatment patterns and outcomes within individual countries, geographic regions, and ultimately, worldwide.

Primary Objectives:

* Characterize the clinical pattern of patients with breast cancer (clinical stage I-IV as defined by the AJCC17).
* Characterize existing and evolving practice patterns.
* Assess patient disease free and overall survival outcomes.

Secondary Objectives:

* Disseminate findings through publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
* Provide supportive data to the development of standard therapies.
* Analyze data and design ancillary studies to address unanswered clinical questions.","['chemotherapy', 'hormonal therapy', 'radiotherapy']","['', '', '']"
NCT00511303,"This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-center trial designed primarily to evaluate the rate of complete or major cytogenetic response of STI571 as demonstrated by a decrease in the percentage of Ph chromosome positive cells in the bone marrow, in patients with CML who are refractory to or intolerant of interferon-alpha.

During the core phase of the study, patients will receive once daily oral administration of STI571 at a dose of 400 mg, for up to 12 months. After completing 12 months of therapy patients may be eligible to receive additional therapy provided that, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient has benefited from treatment with STI571 and in the absence of safety concerns. Patients will receive STI571 on an outpatient basis.

During the extended phase (which is of indefinite duration), patients may continue STI571 until either progression to accelerated phase, blast phase, death, the development of intolerable toxicity, or the investigator feels it is no longer in the patient's best interest to continue therapy, whichever comes first. The number of visits will be at a reduced frequency. Patients who discontinue study drug will be followed for survival for up to 5 years.

STI571 will be considered active if the interferon-refractory patient population satisfies the target of achieving a complete or major response at a rate of at least 30%, within the preset error limits. Cytogenetic responses will be evaluated every three months and categorized as either complete (0% Ph+ chromosome cells), or major (1 to 35% Ph+ chromosome cells) responses. STI571 will be discontinued for any patient whose disease progresses to either the accelerated phase or blast crisis.

A minimum of 100 patients who are interferon refractory will receive STI571 administered at a dose of 400 mg once a day. In addition, the protocol is also open for patients who are intolerant to interferon-alpha in order to get a preliminary evaluation of their response to STI571 therapy. Up to 100 intolerant patients will be enrolled. Enrollment of intolerant patients will cease at 100, or whenever the 100 refractory patients are accrued, whichever comes first.",['STI571'],['imatinib']

NCT00515983,"Background: Sixteen melanoma patients (1 stage IIC, 8 stage III, and 7 stage IV) were treated in a Phase I study to evaluate safety and immune responses, with a vaccine (DC/Apo-Nec) composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with a mixture of apoptotic/necrotic melanoma cell lines (Apo-Nec).

Methods: PBMC were obtained from leukapheresis and DCs were generated from monocytes cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 in serum-free medium. Immature DCs (iDCs) were loaded with gamma-irradiated Apo-Nec cells and injected id without adjuvant. Cohorts of four patients were given four vaccines with 5, 10, 15, or 20 x106 DC/Apo-Nec per vaccine, two weeks apart.

Results: The vaccine was well tolerated in all patients. Toxicity to vaccine was mild, and the toxicity-limiting dose has not been reached. We found that 42.3 ±13.7 % melanoma patients´ iDCs were able to phagocyte Apo-Nec cells wich induced DCs maturation, as evidenced by increased expression of CD83, CD80, CD86, HLA class I and II compared to iDCs. Also, after phagocytosis, a 75.2 ±16 % reduction in Dextran-FITC endocytosis was observed compared to iDCs. CCR7 was upregulated upon Apo-Nec phagocytosis in DCs from all patients and accordingly in vitro DC/Apo-Nec cells were able to migrate towards MIP-3 beta. The DTH score increased significatively in the patients after the first vaccination and slightly decreased by the fourth vaccine (Mann-Whitney Test, p\<0.05). For patient #1 a positive DTH reaction was detected to her own tumor irradiated cells. The presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes specific to gp100 and Melan A/MART-1 Ags were studied by tetramers binding in HLA-A\*0201 patients (7 /15 patients) before and after vaccination. Two patients who remain NED increased Ags their specific T lymphocytes after vaccination. No humoral responses to Apo-Nec cells were detected. With a mean follow-up of 44.5 months post-surgery, the stage IIC pt is NED, 7/8 stage III pts are NED and 7/7 stage IV patients have progressed.

Conclussions: We conclude that DC/Apo-Nec vaccine is well tolerated, it induces specific immunity against melanoma Ags and in stage III patients it may prolong disease-free survival, affording protection from relapse in an adjuvant setting.","['GM-CSF', 'IL-4']","['', '']"

NCT06191692,"Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) infection is a key driver of the TB pandemic, with over 10.6 million people fell ill with TB disease in 2022. About one-quarter of the global population is estimated to be infected with TB bacteria. Around 5-10% of people with TB infection will develop active and contagious TB disease, which could be largely avoided if TB infection is identified and given effective preventative treatment, before progression to active disease. The long treatment of TB infection with regimens lasting from three to nine months is a significant barrier to treatment completion in individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of TB infection. Adapting a shorter regimen than the current regimens could lead to a higher treatment completion rate and increased uptake of preventative therapy for TB, as well as reduced side effects.

Methods and analysis: An open-label, randomized clinical trial (1:1) will be performed in two study sites in Ha Noi, Vietnam (Vietnam National Lung Hospital and Ha Noi Lung Hospital). Adult household contacts (n=350) of people with new, bacteriologically-confirmed, pulmonary, drug-susceptible TB who initiate treatment will be invited to participate.

NCT01698502,"It is well known that continuous physical exercise leads to a number of changes in the body. Maximal oxygen uptake; the heart's pumping ability and muscle mass and strength increases. Also the metabolism adapts: The ability to oxidize fat increase and the insulin sensitivity in primarily in muscle, but also in the liver increase.

Also endocrine glands adapts according to the level of physical activity. It is known that in healthy, younger people the insulin secretion from the pancreas after administration of sugar consumed orally or given directly into a vein, is significantly lower in trained individuals compared with untrained. This change does, however, not only apply to glucose, as also stimulation by the amino acid arginine, shows the same pattern.

It seems plausible that the endocrine glands/cells adapts to the level of physical training, but this has not yet been investigated.

The gastrointestinal tract is the birthplace of a variety of hormones. One group of these is called incretin hormones. They stimulate the glucose dependant insulin secretion in the pancreas and affect hunger/satiety. Whether the incretin production and thus their concentration in the blood is regulated by physical training is unknown.

Obese and patients with type 2 diabetes, has, in contrast to well-trained, decreased insulin sensitivity. As a consequence their (type 2 diabetics, at least early in their disease course) meal stimulated insulin release is greater than in healthy, normal weight individuals. This in spite of the fact that the incretin effect is reduced in obese people and patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy, normal weight.

Whether physical training affects both the secretion of incretins and the incretin effect has not yet been studied.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether incretin hormones in physical well-trained young men have a changed effect on insulin secretion from the pancreas compared to untrained young men. A difference may indicate that the body's endocrine glands adapts to training mode.

The investigators hypothesis is that incretin hormones have a decreased effect on the glucose dependant insulin release in physically trained persons and thus results in a lower insulin release at any given plasma glucose level.",['arginine'],['arginine']

NCT01610557,"Background:

* Diabetic macular edema is a common eye complication of diabetes. It causes the blood vessels in the retina at the back of the eye to leak, causing swelling. The macula is the center part of the retina that is important for seeing fine details and for tasks such as reading, driving, or sewing. Swelling of the macula leads to vision loss and possible blindness. Inflammation may play a role in diabetic macular edema. It is also possible that there is a problem with the blood vessels and the blood supply to cells of the retina.
* A chemical in the body called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important in the formation of blood vessels in the body. Lowering VEGF levels may help treat diabetic macular edema by reducing abnormal leaking blood vessels in the eye. Drugs that can lower or block VEGF include ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Both drugs have been shown to help treat diabetic macular edema. Researchers want to see if one of the drugs works better than the other.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections for diabetic macular edema.

Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have diabetic macular edema in at least one eye.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full eye exam will be performed. Blood and urine samples will be collected.
* One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive treatment. If both eyes are affected, both eyes may be enrolled in the study and receive different drug treatments.
* The main part of the study will last for 9 months. At each study visit, participants will have physical exams and eye exams. They will answer questions about their health and any side effects from the drugs.
* Participants will be assigned to one of four groups. Two groups will have two series of ranibizumab and one series of bevacizumab shots. The other two groups will have two series of bevacizumab and one series of ranibizumab shots. A series is three eye injections of the same drug every 4 weeks. The injections will be given at these study visits. The series order will vary for the different groups.
* After 9 months, participants will continue to have additional study visits. If the treatment seems to be successful, the study doctor may increase the time between visits. Study injections may be given as needed every 4 weeks for up to 3 years.
* Participants may have laser treatments in a study eye if needed. After being in the study for 1 year, they may also have steroid injections or other treatments as directed for the macular edema.","['ranibizumab', 'bevacizumab']","['ranibizumab', 'bevacizumab']"

For those who join the workshops after the health talks will fill in pre- and post- workshop questionnaires (Appendix 4-5). Women who attend the health talk will be recruited on site. Women will be screened by the criteria of eligibility form (Appendix 1) and all eligible women smokers will be asked to sign on informed consents (Appendix 2, 3) before they participate in the programs. After they consent to participate, they will fill in a baseline questionnaire (Appendix 6), and will be assigned to intervention or control group according to the allocation of their company. Some of the eligible women may miss the health talks and directly join the intervention program, because of this situation the intervention group will be further divided into Group A and B: women in Group A will attend health talks and intervention program, women in Group B will only attend intervention program.

Intervention group (Mindfulness Smoking cessation program): Women in intervention group will be provided 2 sessions mindfulness training within 2 weeks. Each session will last for 2 hours with 8-20 participants. For mindfulness training, it aims to understand women smokers' own life planning, stressors and their correlation with smoking; to help women smokers sit with negative affect and alleviate stress through mindfulness; to educate women smokers gain the self-control and replace the smoking habit; to teach women smokers how to prevent craving and relapse. The tentative agenda is shown below:

Session 1 (Introductory) Contents

1. Pre-questionnaire
2. Introducing mindfulness and managing craving with mindfulness
3. Understanding the components of craving and its management

   * The relationship between habitual response and learned association
   * The physiological and psychological withdrawal symptoms
4. Mindfulness yoga practices

Session 2 (Advanced)

Contents

1. Knowledge about impacts of smoking on women's health
2. Recapture the management of craving through mindfulness
3. Mindfulness exercises
4. Mindfulness yoga practices

Responsible person\* SCPW staff \& Yoga teacher

\* SCPW staff would be responsible for the whole session except for the part ""stress reduction and self-control through mindfulness yoga"". It would be held by the yoga teacher.

Control group (Self-help smoking cessation booklet): Only the self-help booklet related to quitting will be provided to the participants.

Evaluation: 1-month telephone interviews will be conducted for control group at 1- (Appendix 97) and 6-month follow-ups will be conducted for both groups (after the last interventions) by trained interviewers (blinded to the group assignment). Participants who have reported abstinence in past 7 days from smoking at 6-month follow-ups will undergo a non-biochemical validation to check their quitting status. They will be invited to have biochemical validation tests (saliva cotinine test and exhaled CO test) at 6-month follow-up.

NCT05903716,"Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease involving the pilosebaceous unit, affecting approximately 95% of adolescents and young adults.

Follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, androgen hormones and inflammation play a role in the pathogenesis of acne. Androgens (Testosterone, DHEA-S and DHT) play a role in the development of acne, hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands and increased sebum production. Androgen receptors are located in the basal layer of the sebaceous glands keratinocytes and they are located in the outer sheath of the hair follicle. These receptors are responsible for the proliferative action of keratinocytes.

The relationship between androgen hormones and acne in women and prepubertal children is well known. Many studies have shown a strong association between acne and hyperandrogenism in women.

Systemic isotretinoin therapy can be used in patients with severe acne vulgaris who do not respond to topical and oral antibiotic treatments.

In recent studies, it has been shown that systemic isotretinoin used in acne treatment changes many hormones such as GnRH, FSH, LH, Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone, TSH, T4 and Prolactin and causes side effects such as menstrual irregularity and hirsutism.

However, data on the effect of oral isotretinoin on adrenal and sex hormones are contradictory.

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of oral isotretinoin on adrenal steroid and sex hormone levels and to compare it with a healthy control.

Isotretinoin treatment is started in acne vulgaris patients at a dose of 0.5-0.8mg/kg/day. The total cumulative dose is 120 mg/kg.

At baseline and at the 3rd month of isotretinoin treatment, 17-OH Progesterone, DHEA, DHEAS, Androstenedione, Aldosterone, Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, Estradiol, 17-OH Pregnenolone, Androsterone, Cortisol, Corticosterone, 11-Degesterone, 21, -Deoxycortisol, Pregnenolone, 11-Deoxycorticostreone hormones will be evaluated with LCMS/MS technique.

In addition, the FSH, LH, Prolactin, Estrogen, Testosterone, free testosterone, DHEA-s, SHBG, TSH, T4 hormone levels of the patients will be evaluated by ELISA method.

In the baseline 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th months of the treatment and 3 months after the treatment, the patients' height, weight, body mass index measurements, VAS scoring of patient treatment satisfaction, Global Acne Severity Score, Acne Quality of Life Score, and Modified Ferriman Gallwey Score for hirsutism will be recorded.

NCT05865288,"Introduction: Oxytocin (OT) is a nine-amino acid neuropeptide known to play a vital part in social behaviors and has also been found to be involved the social manifestations of mental illnesses, such as social manifestations and social cognition. it has been suggested that OT administration may serve as an add-on treatment for individuals with mental illnesses.

One group of patients affected by social are patients with eating disorders (EDs). Studies of OT administration among individuals with EDs have shown an inconsistent pattern of findings, which might be associated with the differential baseline level of OT dysregulation. Thus OT dosing needs to be optimized, while considering patients baseline OT levels prior to administration. Patients with ED are also known to have lower OT levels at baseline. It is possible that OT's administration will affect interpersonal behavior through the increase of lowered OT levels, thus leading to overall improvement of ED symptoms.

This study aims to examine the effects of OT administration among patients with EDs, while focusing on baseline OT levels and interpersonal abilities as potential moderators and/or mediators of its effects. The research addresses the following questions: (1) is OT administration associated with increased therapeutic gains among patients with ED? (2) what are the moderators and mediators of these effects, and specifically, do baseline levels of OT and baseline interpersonal abilities moderate these effects? (3) what is the mechanism underlying OT's therapeutic effects, and specifically do changes in interpersonal abilities and changes in OT levels serve a mediating role? Methods: This study aims to assess the differential effect of OT administration among patients with varying levels of baseline saliva OT and to explore the effects of optimizing frequency and dosage of administration of OT, based on baseline characteristics.

Participants: Female and male Individuals (N=90) with verified diagnosis of EDs, age 16 and above, will participate in at least four weeks of treatment at the EDs unit. Subjects will be recruited at the Teradion Eating Disorder Clinic, an outpatient unit in North Israel.

Procedure: Patients and caregivers will sign an informed consent form. Baseline saliva OT will be measured four times during consecutive days. At week 1 patients will be assessed for general distress, ED symptoms, cognitive rigidity, interpersonal abilities, as well as patients and therapists reported working alliance. At week 2 patients will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 with 60 patients receiving OT and 30 receiving placebo. Patients will receive 24 IU of OT or placebo, once a week, prior to therapy sessions, for a period of 4 weeks. During these weeks (2-5), they will be assessed for levels of OT, general distress, interpersonal abilities, working alliance and cognitive rigidity. All measurements will be performed finally at week 6.

Novelty: This study is the first to assess the effectiveness of OT as an add-on for patients with EDs, during clinical treatment, as well as to explore modulators such as baseline OT levels, and mediators such as social abilities and cognitive rigidity, on the overall improvement of ED patients in therapy.",['Oxytocin'],['oxytocin']

NCT04835571,"In the entire world most people die from cardiovascular disease. Death is primarily from myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke which are most often caused by rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Patients with high-grade, i.e. ≥ 70% carotid artery stenosis are at especially high risk. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies show that two features inside plaques that are associated with the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent cardiovascular events are: lipid rich necrotic core (LRNC) and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH).

MRI studies on carotid artery plaques typically relies on proton-density-weighted fast-spin echo, blood-suppressed T1- and T2-weighted gradient-echo sequences. The end-result is nonquantitative measures, where plaque features are identified due to their relative signal intensity. To address these problems of non-specificity, we developed a quantitative MRI (qMRI) technique based on Dixon sequences.

The study intention is to enable in-depth analysis of plaque features and their relation to clinical data. For example there is an insufficient understanding of associations between lipid biomarkers and plaque contents. Our hypothesis is that we can identify quantitative changes in both plaque and lipid biomarkers after one year of optimized cardiovascular risk management (including treatment with lipid lowering drugs), and establish if there is any associations between these features. Because there is a well-established link between systemic inflammation and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques we will also study the relationship between LRNC and IPH as measured by qMRI versus circulating markers of inflammation.

Method: Patients with known carotid stenosis are invited for a baseline visit and a 1-year follow up visit. The study visits include clinical assessment, blood tests, patient interview and magnetic resonance imaging of the carotid arteries. All participants are offered optimized cardiovascular risk management through the individual assessment by the study physicians.",['lipid lowering drugs'],['']
NCT00963612,"Liver resection and liver transplantation are the acceptable treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). But the long-term survival is unsatisfactory as a result of high rate of intra and extra hepatic recurrences. Microvascular invasion (MVI) is the most significant risk factor affecting recurrence-free survival in patients following liver resection and liver transplantation. Tumor hypoxia (lack of adequate blood supply) is the single most important factor that predict MVI and post surgical prognosis.

Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic method of assessing tumor hypoxia by detecting signal changes secondary to changes in blood flow and oxygenation. BOLD MRI assessment of tumor hypoxia in HCC has never been correlated with pathological confirmation of MVI, the gold standard to assess MVI in HCC. In this study, the investigators propose to assess the ability of BOLD MRI to provide a discriminating quantitative threshold of intratumoral oxygenation predictive of MVI.","['Ibuprofen', 'Acetaminophen']","['ibuprofen', 'paracetamol']"

NCT03240263,"Prolonged mechanical ventilation secondary to weaning failure demands a significant amount of intensive care unit (ICU) resources, thus increasing the economic burden of public healthcare costs. One of the proposed mechanisms accounting for weaning failure is the concept that excessive work of breathing for weak respiratory muscles during the liberation from mechanical ventilation compromises cerebral blood flow, thereby predisposing the brain to dysfunction. Restriction in brain perfusion could have an adverse impact on the function of the respiratory muscles by impairing the output of the respiratory centre thus promoting respiratory muscle fatigue, leading to weaning failure. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been shown to improve the functional capacity of the inspiratory muscles in patients with respiratory muscle weakness whilst has been recently proposed as a possible additional component of weaning strategies. Therefore, this project aims to identify both a mechanism that might be linked to prolong ICU length of stay and that at the same time might be amenable to treatment.","['inspiratory muscle training', 'IMT']","['', '']"

Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (¹⁸FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (¹⁸FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity.

The authors noted that the need for botulinum toxin was reduced in 2 patients out of 6. No study has been conducted to date on the splinting + toxin combination in adults.

Another study showed that stretching sessions over 2 weeks of a muscle just given botulinum toxin helped improve the toxin's efficacy 2, 6 and 12 weeks after the injection. For this reason, rehabilitation teams routinely prescribe 10 sessions of physiotherapy for 15 days after botulinum treatment.

Based on this principle, we hypothesise that dynamic night splinting applied just after botulinum toxin treatment may also increase the toxin's efficacy. We chose a dynamic splint providing continuous stretching of the wrist and fingers in extension whilst allowing active flexion. Night splinting is thought to promote optimal functional use of the paretic upper limb during the day and thus prevent learned non-use, which could worsen the spasticity.

Each patient will receive treatment cycles, whose results will be compared, so that each patient will act as his/her own control. The evaluation will be based on the Tardieu scale chosen for its greater inter-individual reproducibility and greater reliability to measure spasticity.

The degree of extension of wrist and fingers provided by the splint will be adjusted to the patient's clinical condition with the elastic tensioners. The purpose of the splint is to maintain the stretch beyond the Tardieu spasticity angle at fast speed (V3) without reaching maximum extension, which could be harmful.

This protocol is designed to determine whether dynamic night hand splinting combined with botulinum toxin injections will improve botulinum antispastic efficacy in adults with brain damage.",['botulinum toxin'],['']
NCT03398681,"Recent studies have shown that treatment with intravenous iron in patients with iron deficiency (ID) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) improves symptomatology, functional capacity, quality of life, and decreases hospitalizations regardless of anemia. In addition, a decrease in myocardial iron content has been observed in patients with chronic HFrEF. This preliminary evidence has led to postulate that myocardial iron deficiency could play a direct role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.

The investigators hypothesize that the repletion of myocardial iron would explain part of the benefit of this treatment. Thus, the investigators postulate that cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (T2\* and T1-mapping sequences) will be sensible enough to detect changes in myocardial iron content as a result of intravenous iron administration, and that such changes will correlate with simultaneous changes in parameters of heart failure severity.

In this double-blind 1:1 randomized study controlled by placebo the investigators aim to determine the changes in myocardial iron content after treatment with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) by CMR at 7 and 30 days in patients with stable HFrEF and ID.","['intravenous iron', 'ferric carboxymaltose']","['', 'ferric carboxymaltose']"

NCT02759835,"Background:

Some non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have a mutation in a gene that makes a protein called EGFR. This particular cancer can be treated with certain drugs such as erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso). But many tumors become resistant to these drugs because of a second mutation. Researchers want to test if adding local ablative therapy (LAT) extends the benefits of the drug, osimertinib. LAT can include techniques such as surgery, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or radiation therapy.

Objective:

To test if re-taking osimertinib after LAT is safe, tolerable, and effective for people whose NSCLC has progressed after initial treatment with osimertinib.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older with certain types of NSCLC. Participants will be divided into various groups as described below.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Tumor scans

Eye exam

Review of tumor sample.

Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day. They will continue until they can no longer tolerate it or their disease worsens. They will keep a dosage diary.

All participants will start each 21-day course with physical exam; blood, urine, and saliva tests; and electrocardiogram. They will have scans every 6 weeks and echocardiogram every 3 months.

Groups 1 and 2 will:

Start osimertinib right away.

Have LAT if their disease progresses and is suitable for LAT. If LAT cannot be performed or LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed.

Re-start osimertinib after LAT, or other treatments if not suitable for LAT.

Group 3 will:

Have LAT.

If LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed.

Start osimertinib after LAT.

NCT01000233,"Intervention study focused on preventing the progression of aortic valve calcification.

Vascular and cardiac calcifications are a marker of risk and poor outcome, especially the severe calcified aortic stenosis and coronary calcification.

Its increasing prevalence is now a health problem. The knowledge and the therapeutic objective of this condition have changed in recent years and pathophysiological aspects at present, focus on atherosclerotic disease and inflammation.

Several clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that statins or ACE inhibitors prevent the progression of cardiovascular calcification.

NCT03331822,"In the majority of intensive care units, nurses work 12 hour shifts that consist of days and nights. Shift work outside of 6am-6pm has been reported to cause fatigue, induce sleep disorders, and cause metabolic disturbances. This shift to a nocturnal 'day' rather than diurnal, can result in reduced work performance, processing errors, accidents at work, absenteeism, and reduced quality of life. More chronically, those working at night have been shown to experience higher risks of heart disease, cancer and shorter median durations of life span. Much of this elevated risk is thought to be due to altered exposure to light, the dominant environmental cue regulating our circadian rhythms.

As diurnal organisms much of our biology is regulated by the solar day. Acutely, bright light exposure (i.e., sun) regulates the phase of the biological clock principally through the suppression of melatonin, which biologically mediates increased alertness and in essence, 'our daytime alertness'. During the night melatonin gradually increases and induces tiredness and ultimately sleep. This, in part, is biology behind the use of melatonin in those with sleep disturbances or to mitigate jet lag, with cross-continental or transoceanic flights.

In this study, the investigators will randomize nurses in the hospital to receive either high intensity white light (3,000 lux) or standard ambient white fluorescent (\~400 lx) light for 10 hours during their night shift. This high illuminance light, rich in blue spectrum, is what diurnal creatures, like humans, are exposed to during the day. The lights may subsequently be equipped with blue filters (442 nm) to heighten the exposure to the rich blue spectrum light. Exposure will commence at the beginning of the night shift (\~7pm) and continue for 10 hours. The rationale for terminating exposure prior to shift end is to foster an onset of sleep biology. At the end of each shift, the nurses will complete the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Saliva samples will be collected for melatonin level analysis and the nurses will complete sleep diaries at home. The investigators hypothesize that exposure to high intensity lighting during night shifts will reduce fatigue and enhance alertness and computational capacity that correlates with reduced melatonin.",['melatonin'],['melatonin']

NCT03728595,"Patients with chronic lung diseases travelling by plane often suffer with symptoms related to lower oxygen levels they are exposed to while flying.

Therefore, patients with respiratory conditions are routinely assessed to establish if they need supplemental oxygen in flight. A hypoxic altitude simulation test (HAST) is often part of this assessment and consists in having patients breathe a oxygen/nitrogen blend with a lower oxygen concentration compared to normal room air, simulating in-flight conditions. Oxygen levels are measured before and after the test through a blood sample (from the earlobe or an artery in the wrist) and with a finger probe. In-flight oxygen is required if the oxygen level in the blood is lower than 6.6 kPa. HASTs are time consuming, costly, and require a dedicated hospital appointment.

Using historical data, the Investigators developed scores based on capillary blood gas (blood sample from the earlobe), diagnosis and sex to predict the outcome of the HASTs. The Investigators validated the proposed scores in a separate historic cohort of patients and showed it had good concordance with the HASTs results.

In this study, the Investigators want to confirm prospectively if the score, based on blood results (venous and/or earlobe), can predict the outcome of the HASTs and therefore reduce the number of tests performed, travel time for patients, and costs for the NHS.

The clinical activity and favorable toxicity profile of osimertinib has led to broadly research into this drug as a strategy to inhibit and prevent drug resistance in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer). Evidences of benefit from EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients have been increasing in early stages as well as in advance stages. Therefore, adjuvant or neo adjuvant EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in operable NSCLC(non small cell lung cancer) patients could improve survival in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients.

Acquired resistance by widespread clinical use has become a hot clinical problem.

A variety of target therapies are being developed to overcome tolerance to osimertinib to improve this outcome.

This is an approach that should improve the molecular and clinical understanding of the drug resistance. Specifically, we want to investigate innate drug resistance and tumor microenvironment to osimertinib by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). and single cell research is obviously needed to develop cancer therapeutic strategies.","['osimertinib', 'ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen']","['osimertinib', 'ibuprofen', 'paracetamol']"
NCT00766064,"Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder and treatment response to pharmacological interventions has been modest for these patients. Chronic elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart rate and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or norepinephrine-serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are considered treatment of first choice for these patients, however a substantial portion of patients do not respond sufficiently (Zhang and Davidson 2007). Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective add-on treatment strategies for these patients. Recently, atypical neuroleptics have received considerable attention since it was shown in multiple controlled and naturalistic trials that these medications are an effective treatment option for patients with PTSD (Davis et al 2006). In chronic PTSD, the psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment have yet been inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanisms of medications used in the treatment of PTSD. Therefore, in addition to evaluating the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of paliperidone, a novel atypical neuroleptic, in the treatment of PTSD, we also aim to compare neurophysiological responses at baseline with post-treatment effects in antidepressant-refractory PTSD patients.

Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of paliperidone in patients with PTSD.

NCT05682053,"Background :

Medullary sponge kidney disease is a congenital disorder caracterised by tubular ectasia and cystic dilatation of the collecting ducts in the pericalyceal region of the renal pyramids, which can lead to nephrolithiasis and frequently associated with impaired tubular function such as distal renal tubular acidosis.

The disease knowledge is limited, especially about origin, diagnosis, and physiopathology of the disease.

The disease is associated with impaired tubular function such as distal renal tubular acidosis, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, which suggest altered kidney medulla function.

Multiparametric MRI may provide further informations about the physiopathology and help in earlier diagnosis of the medullary sponge kidney.

Objective :

The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that early kidney medulla function alteration in medullary sponge kidney can be detected and characterised with multiparametric MRI. We are expecting to see in medullary sponge kidney a decreased oxygenation content in BOLD MRI (Blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging), and decreased ADC (Apparent diffusion coefficient) value in the medulla.

Design :

A monocentric prospective case/control study will be conducted in adults with medullary sponge kidney. Controls are adults patients with glomerular filtration rate \> 60 mL/min/1.73m2 without kidney stone attending a renal exploration.

After a screening visit, patients included will be evaluated on one day with lithiasis assessment and measurement of glomerular filtration (Urinary collection of the last 24 hours, Urine sample, Blood sample) and they will perform multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the kidneys.",[],[]

NCT03927391,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in Western countries. When the disease recurs as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) it is associated with a median overall survival of approximately 2 years with significant decrement in quality of life due to additional cancer-specific and treatment-induced morbidity. Palliative agents currently used in the CRPC setting include the 2nd generation hormonal agents abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide but also radium-223, docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Choices for treatment strategies are based on multiple factors such as age, co-morbidity and drug toxicity profile. The side effect profile of enzalutamide is associated with central nervous system (CNS side effects) such as fatigue and depression. The mechanism for these side effects is not yet fully understood, but it was shown in rodent studies that enzalutamide and its active metabolite penetrate into the CNS. This might cause the CNS side effects that were later seen in the phase 1 study where fatigue was found to be a dose-dependent adverse event. After dose reductions the symptoms resolved. This was also found in a retrospective study of Japanese metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients (n=345) in which the side effects malaise and nausea decreased remarkably after dose reduction. However, no exposure-response relation was observed in the study of Gibbons et al. Additionally, based on the data of the phase 1 trial of enzalutamide it can be suggested that a minimum trough concentration of 5.0 mg/L could be considered as a target for exposure to enzalutamide. In particular, frail (m)CRPC patients are more prone to develop CNS side effects on enzalutamide. The investigator's hypothesis is that dose reduction to 75% (120mg) can be safely done to treat (m)CRPC in these patients with preserving optimal efficacy and less CNS side effects.","['abiraterone acetate', 'enzalutamide', 'radium-223', 'docetaxel', 'cabazitaxel']","['abiraterone acetate', 'enzalutamide', '', 'docetaxel', 'cabazitaxel']"

NCT04801121,"Diabetic pregnancies are often complicated by placental dysfunction with reduced transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus, which may compromise fetal growth and organ development. In diabetic pregnancies, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia very often leads to fetal macrosomia. The combination of reduced placental oxygen transfer and increasing fetal demand due to fetal overgrowth may possess a particular risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.

Current methods in the antenatal identification of placental dysfunction relies on estimates of fetal size and fetal wellbeing using ultrasound including Doppler flows measurements. These measurements are only indirect estimates of placental function, as no clinical method exists to assess placental function directly. In diabetic pregnancies, the estimates are further limited due to fetal overgrowth and unreliable Doppler. In addition, in diabetic pregnancies, intrauterine fetal weight estimates by ultrasound are inaccurate because of asymmetric fetal growth. Therefore, new accurate methods to assess placental function, fetal oxygenation and fetal growth in this particular group of high-risk pregnancies is highly needed. Early and precise identification of pathology in diabetes pregnancy may lead to an improved outcome in the offspring, as precise identification of pathology facilitates important obstetric decisions in regards to maternal antidiabetic treatment and timing of delivery. Resent research indicates that MRI is useful for this purpose.

It is well described, that preeclampsia is associated with an increased maternal risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Recent studies suggest, that pregestational subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction, in particular left ventricular dysfunction, may increase the risk of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction during pregnancy. Cardiac MRI is a sensitive method to detect subclinical maternal cardiac dysfunction, which may be used in identification of high-risk pregnancies. In addition, the longitudinal design of this study allows for the investigation of cardiovascular changes during pregnancies in normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by diabetes.

The overall aim of this study is to improve the antenatal fetal and maternal monitoring in diabetes pregnancies. Early and precise identification of pregnancy pathology provides a better basis for important obstetric decisions regarding antidiabetic treatment, monitoring intervals and timing of delivery, which leads to a better outcome for the mother and offspring.

In this study, a vaccine developed by IIBR for SARS-CoV-2 virus will be assessed for its safety and potential efficacy in volunteers. The study is comprised of two phases, a dose-escalation phase (phase I) during which subjects (18-55 years old) will be randomly allocated to receive a single administration of IIBR-100 at low, mid or high dose or saline or two administrations of IIBR-100 at low dose, or saline, 28 days apart.

Based on results obtained during phase I, and cumulative phase I data review, the expansion phase (phase II) has begun, during which larger cohorts as well as elderly age subjects were initially planned to be randomly allocated to receive a single administration of IIBR-100 at low, mid or high dose or saline, or two administrations of IIBR-100 at low, mid or high dose (prime-boost) or saline, 28 days apart. Additional top-dose (prime-boost) may be implemented when immunogenicity of any prime-boost arm is considered insufficient. However, based on immunogenicity preliminary data and DSMB recommendations, only the two administrations of mid, high and top dose (prime-boost) or saline will continue in the study.

NCT03132792,"This first time in human study is intended for men and women between 18 and 75 years of age who have advanced liver cancer which has grown or returned after being treated or another AFP expressing tumor. Those who did not tolerate or refused other therapies may also participate. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells that target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with liver cancer or other AFP expressing tumor types. This study is for subjects who have a blood test positive for appropriate HLA-A\*02 P Group and have adequate AFP protein in blood or tumor, and whose noncancerous liver tissue has very little AFP protein (Liver only).

The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells.

The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back to the subject through an intravenous infusion after 3 days of chemotherapy. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.

Subjects will be hospitalized for at least 1 week after receiving their T cells back and then seen frequently by the Study Physician for the next 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every three months. If subjects have disease progression or withdraw from the study, they will then be entered into a long-term follow up for safety monitoring.

NCT05264142,"CYP2C19 is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 10% of drugs currently on the market, including several proton pump inhibitors, clopidogrel, benzodiazepines and some tricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline. It is a cytochrome whose activity is characterized by a great variability in the general population. This variability can be explained, in part, by genetic and environmental factors The classification of phenotypes associated with CYP2C19 has evolved over time. Today, five distinct phenotypes are used to characterize this variability: the slow metabolizer (SM) phenotype, the intermediate metabolizer (IM) phenotype, the normal metabolizer (NM) phenotype, the fast metabolizer (RM) phenotype and finally the ultra-fast metabolizer (UM) phenotype. (UM) phenotype.

Although directly measurable with test substances, CYP2C19 phenotypes are often assigned on the basis of genotype. They may be impacted by intrinsic (e.g., comorbidities) or extrinsic (e.g., co-medications) factors. Phenoconversion or phenotypic change is the phenomenon by which an individual switches from one phenotype to another due to an environmental influence such as a drug interaction. However, genotype is likely to influence the degree of response to a drug interaction. Vulnerability to phenoconversion therefore differs according to the genotype of the individual.

The purpose of our study is to determine whether individuals genetically MR, NM and IM have the same vulnerability to phenoconversion. Thus, the magnitude of the response to CYP2C19 inhibition will be studied in these 3 groups of individuals (NM:\*1/\*1, RM:\*1/\*17 and IM:\*1/\*2-\*2/\*17). Inhibition will be studied in two steps, using a strong (fluvoxamine) and a weak (voriconazole) inhibitor of CYP2C19.","['proton pump inhibitors', 'clopidogrel', 'benzodiazepines', 'tricyclic antidepressants', 'amitriptyline', 'fluvoxamine', 'voriconazole']","['', 'clopidogrel', '', '', 'amitriptyline', 'fluvoxamine', 'voriconazole']"

In 2015, 68% of men and 58% of women in the UK were overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. Hormonal regulation of appetite has been shown to influence body weight and body fat . Gut hormones secreted from the intestine are particularly important both in the regulation of appetite and blood glucose level, and recently the gut hormone Glucagon Like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) has been successfully targeted to treat both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Targeting the gut microbiota has been shown to influence gut hormones, in a way is likely to help treat or prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. In past decades, considerable attention has been given to investigating the new applications of natural prebiotic polymers on gut microbiota composition. Moreover, recent trend in research indicates a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system through the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA).

NCT00376077,"Childhood immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is a disorder characterized by the production of antibodies against platelets, resulting in enhanced destruction of platelets. Most children with ITP present with low platelet counts (PC) but minimal bleeding. Very rarely a child may present with a severe life-threatening bleed, such as a bleed in the head. In this case it is very important that the PC be raised as quickly as possible. The combination of corticosteroids and intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) is commonly used in the management of such severe bleeding in children with ITP to quickly raise the PC and yet this treatment combination has not been tested against using IVIG alone. If it is shown that the combination of these agents does result in a quicker rise in PC then when using IVIG alone would support the use of this combination therapy in emergency situations.

As we can not ethically conduct this study in patients with life-threatening bleeds, we plan to study patients with ITP and PC less than 20 X 109/L, but without life threatening bleeding. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of these 2 regimens (IVIG + placebo or IVIG + IV corticosteroids). The study is designed as a double-blind trial, where the patient or the treating physician will not be aware of the regimen that a patient is randomized to.

Tacrolimus is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and important interindividual variations of its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Proteins CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are responsible of intestinal and hepatic metabolism of Tacrolimus. Various polymorphisms for CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 were described and several retrospective studies suggested an association between a genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5 and the pharmacokinetic parameters of Tacrolimus. In particular, we showed that the presence of an allele CYP3A5\*1 was associated to the use of more important amounts of Tacrolimus to obtain the desired blood concentrations.

This study is a national, multicentric, prospective, opened, randomized on two arms of treatment. 280 receivers of a renal transplant in 12 centres will be included. The genotyping of gene CYP3A5 will be carried out in the 6 days following transplantation. During the first week, the patients will be treated by basiliximab, MMF and corticosteroids.

NCT01761786,"Rationale: the use of antiplatelet drugs (i.e. clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) is crucial in the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation to prevent atherothrombotic events. Ticagrelor and prasugrel are more effective in preventing atherothrombotic events, but with a higher risk of bleeding complications, compared to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite by CYP2C19. Carriers of the non functional CYP2C19\*2 and \*3 alleles have an impaired CYP2C19 capacity, making clopidogrel less effective. For these subjects ticagrelor or prasugrel is an alternative.

Objective: to assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the CYP2C19 genotype guided antiplatelet treatment strategy, using clopidogrel in non-carriers of a CYP2C19\*2 or \*3 allele and ticagrelor or prasugrel in carriers of a CYP2C19\*2 or \*3 allele in STEMI patients.

Intervention: the intervention group will be genotyped for CYP2C19\*2 and \*3 allele variants within 48 hours after primary PCI. Carriers will receive either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or prasugrel (10 mg once daily or 5 mg once daily if the patient is older than age 75 or has a body weight less than 60 kg), according to local standards. Non-carriers will be treated with clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). The control group receives either ticagrelor or prasugrel, according to local standards at the same dosage as the CYP2C19\*2 or \*3 carriers in the intervention group.

NCT05149131,"This is an observational study in which patient data from the past on men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is studied.

Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is a type of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and still responds to treatment that lowers testosterone levels.

Cancer is a condition in which the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form tumors in organs or other parts of the body. If tumors form in the prostate, male hormones (androgens) can sometimes help the cancer spread and grow. The main hormone that does this is called testosterone and is mainly made in the testicles. Men with prostate cancer can have treatments to try to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. One possible treatment is surgery to remove the testicles. Another option is taking treatments to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. These are called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In men with mCSPC, ADT can help to stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Men with mCSPC can also receive ""treatment intensification"". This means that they receive ADT as well as other treatments for their prostate cancer. Other studies that looked at treatment of mCSPC in Canada have found that most men with mCSPC do not receive treatment intensification.

In this study, the researchers want to collect more data about the men who had mCSPC and the types of treatment they received for their mCSPC. The researchers will look at the health information of adult men in Alberta, Canada who had at least 1 dose of treatment for their mCSPC between January 2016 and December 2020 or earlier.

The study will first look at the health information of men whose cancer had metastasized or spread to other parts of the body, beyond the prostate, at the time they were diagnosed with prostate cancer.

And later, if feasible to do, the study may also look at the health information from men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer that was limited to the prostate, and over time spread to other parts of the body.

The researchers will collect information from databases, a census, and pharmacy records. This will help the researchers learn more about:

* whether the men received ADT alone, or ADT with treatment intensification
* additional information about the men, including their age, income, level of education, residential area (urban or rural) and the more information about the treatments received
* how the men's symptoms affected their daily lives
* how severe the men's cancer was
* changes in laboratory values as markers for changes to the blood, liver, kidney, bone or other organs
* need for additional treatment
* where the men's cancer may have spread to in other parts of the body.

NCT02663180,"Depression is a serious mental health disease. It is generally characterized by sadness, loss of interest in activities, and decreased energy. Globally, it is estimated that almost 350 million people suffer from depression. In Saudi Arabia, literature suggested that prevalence of depression among boy's secondary school students in Abha city was 38.2%. Another study found that the prevalence of depression was 22.4 % as moderate, 7.3 % as severe and 3.7% as very severe, with a clear predominance prevalence of depression in girls as in boys (1.5 times). It is important to assess depression literacy including knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders among adolescent. A high level of mental health literacy on depression leads to a better understanding and outcomes of depressive disorders. Schools are a typical venue in which to embed mental health literacy because the school students are more familiar with educational activities. Studies concluded that educational intervention about depression literacy and destigmatization improves knowledge and may decrease stigma. Further research, intervention and activism are needed in the field of mental health in Arab countries to improve awareness of mental health problems.

Objectives: This study is aimed to measure the effect of educational intervention program about depression among secondary schools in Jazan city on depression literacy and stigma during the academic year 2015-2016.

The intervention: the intervention will held at each selected intervention school separately. The program will be over 2 weeks intervention as the following:

* Educational strategies: 2 Lecture about depression 30 minutes supported by group discussion, brochures and display of posters with mental-health slogans on depression in the schools.
* Contact strategies: the investigators will show a video of a young male who had been diagnosed (i.e., not an actor) with depression.

Benefits:

\* The intervention group will join educational intervention program they expected to benefit from the program through increase their depression literacy and improve depression stigma, and control group will not join any form of intervention.

Risk: There is no expected risk for participating in the study.

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-ray to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgens, or male sex hormones, can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as apalutamide, may help stop or reduce the growth of prostate cancer cell growth by blocking the attachment of androgen to its receptors on cancer cells, a mechanism similar to stopping the entrance of a key into its lock.

NCT04438161,"Childhood Maltreatment (CM) has highly deleterious effects on human development and is a preventable known cause of enduring psychopathology in the United States. Infants and young children are at particularly high risk for physical harm from abuse and neglect, comprising over 60% of all child maltreatment fatalities. An increasing number of studies point to the ability to target prevention of CM by estimating individual specific risk at the time of birth, on the basis of readily-accessible data elements of birth records. This clinical trial is a randomized controlled trial embedded within a prospective longitudinal study, in which families of infants recruited prenatally or in the newborn period are randomized to an enhanced level of engagement in resource navigation, which we refer to as Personalized Education Regarding Clinical and Community Supports (PERCCS). The enhancement involves keying recommendations for evidence-informed interventions for the prevention of CM to established risk factors for ascertained within a family.

The parent longitudinal cohort study involves enrollment of a diverse population of families of newborns (prenatally or in the immediate postnatal period) for the purpose of ascertaining sociodemographic, psychological (eg. parental stress) and family psychiatric risk factors for (a) child maltreatment (b) unmet service needs, and (c) adverse behavioral outcomes of the children. Families are contacted quarterly to track acquisition of support services that are relevant to the prevention of child maltreatment. At age 18 months early childhood behavioral outcomes are ascertained, biomaterials collected, and official-report child maltreatment records from the State of Missouri are individually cross-matched with identifiers of the children and their parents.

Two major outcomes are examined:

The first is whether the engagement protocol results in a higher level of acquisition and active participation in recommended preventive intervention services by the families (including home visitation, parental mental health care, evidence-based parenting education, and others delineated in Table 1, see below).

The second is the rate of child maltreatment (CM) ascertained in official Missouri state administrative records for which individual informed consent to individually-cross reference is obtained by the families in the course of their enrollment in the parent longitudinal study.",[],[]

Diagnostic radiography is commonly used in this population to differentiate diagnosis and to assess changes after treatment. While X-ray and CT provide quality imaging, they also expose infants to ionizing radiation. MR imaging offers a safe, non-ionizing alternative. However, imaging lungs via 1H MR is intrinsically difficult due to multiple air-tissue interfaces within the lungs causing local gradients and severe magnetic field susceptibility, which leads to an exceedingly short effective transverse relaxation time (T2\*). Additionally, the lungs have low proton density, which along with the short T2\* results in low signal to noise ratio, and the physiological motion caused by respiration and cardiac pulsation further reduces lung signal. The development of more powerful hardware, along with faster MRI techniques, has enabled detailed noninvasive 1H MR imaging of pulmonary tissues. Additionally, the development of inhaled hyperpolarized gas MRI has led to breakthroughs in the ability to visualize and quantify regional ventilation and alveolar size.",[],[]
NCT01641458,"The fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and capecitabine (Cp) are among the most commonly used anticancer drugs. Still, there is much controversy about the correct dosing, and the fact that a minority of patients experience severe, sometimes even lethal toxicity following treatment. One important factor predisposing patients to severe toxicity is deficiency in the 5FU-catabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Our group identified 4 DPD risk alleles in over 300 Swiss cancer patients, that resulted in a 8-times increased risk of experiencing severe toxicity from 5FU or Cp. In patients receiving 5FU as a continuous infusion, there are accumulating data that keeping the AUC of 5FU between 20-30 mg\*h/L is beneficial in terms of treatment toxicity and activity. In this study, patients carrying at least 1/4 DPD risk alleles will receive a 50% dose reduction of either 5FU or Cp, with the potential of later dose increases in the abscence of severe toxicity. Additionally, patients receiving i.v. 5FU will undergo therapeutic drug monitoring at the end of the 2-day continuous infusion, with subsequent dose adaptations to target a 5FU AUC of 20-30 mg\*h/L.

Plaques formed in MS can develop at any point in the brain and spinal cord, causing various symptoms and adversely affecting the patient's quality of life. Although not counted among the affected neurological systems, one of the most important symptoms experienced by MS patients is sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction in MS may occur due to symptoms of MS such as spasticity, fatigue, and bladder problems, due to the presence of lesions affecting the neural pathways. The most common method used in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in women with MS is sexual counseling. The PLISSIT model is one of the most frequently used models by health professionals in sexual counseling and evaluation. PLISSIT stands for Permission, limited Information, Specific Suggestion and Intensive Therapy.

NCT00078494,"This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to prevent recurrence of nasopharyngeal cancer. The likelihood of this cancer returning is higher in patients whose original lesion was large, whose cancer had spread to the adjacent lymph nodes, or who had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that spread beyond the primary site). Nasopharyngeal tumors are caused by a common virus called Epstein-Barr virus, which produces a protein called LMP-2. Vaccination with specific pieces, or peptides, of the LMP-2 protein may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide.

Patients 18 years of age and older whose nasopharyngeal cancer has been controlled by standard treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. x-rays and other imaging studies are also done in patients who have not had these tests recently. All candidates are tested for HLA tissue type. Only patients with type HLA-A\*1101 or HLA-A\*2402 - the types on which the two vaccines in this study are based - receive vaccine therapy; others are offered standard medical treatment and observation.

Participants are randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two different vaccines (LMP-2:340-349 or LMP-2:419-427) to determine which peptide may offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of weekly immunizations for 8 consecutive weeks. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (about every 3 months), patients undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations are given at the NIH Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects. Immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the cancer does not return.

Patients are followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating blood. The blood is processed by a machine that separates and removes the lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Patients not receiving the vaccine also undergo leukapheresis to assess their natural response to LMP-2. Some patients may have a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the vaccine's effects on the tumor immune cells.

Patients who show no evidence of immunization against the LMP-2 protein after two courses of vaccine treatment are subsequently be followed with observation alone. Those who do respond to the vaccine are offered two additional courses of treatment to strengthen the response or to be followed by observation alone.

NCT04619927,"Rationale: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common presentation of atherosclerosis. For the prevention of adverse events related to arterial thrombosis in PAD patients, clopidogrel is recommended. Clopidogrel in itself is inactive and needs to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) into the active metabolite. About 30% of PAD patients receiving clopidogrel is carrying one or two CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) and do not or to a limited extent convert the prodrug into its active metabolites, and are therefore at increased risk of adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis. We hypothesize that genotype-guided prescription of antithrombotic treatment reduces adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis.

Objective: The primary aim of the GENPAD study is to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided antithrombotic treatment to reduce adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis in PAD patients. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided antithrombotic treatment to reduce the separate elements of the primary composite outcome and to assess the risk of clinically relevant bleedings in patients allocated to the genotype-guided antiplatelet treatment versus standard clopidogrel prescription.

Study design: A randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter trial. Study population: Patients (n=2276) with PAD consulting a vascular surgeon for diagnosis and/or treatment, receiving clopidogrel according to the guidelines.

NCT03837977,"There is currently no standard treatment beyond first-line etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore the treatment of patients whose disease progresses on or after this first-line treatment is an area of unmet need.

Combination regimens such as irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid are a second-line treatment option currently used in Europe and world-wide for this subset of patients. However, there is currently no trial evidence supporting this treatment regimen in these patients.

Results of the NAPOLI-1 phase III trial of liposomal irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after gemcitabine-based therapy reported improved survival for those patients who received a combination of liposomal irinotecan with 5-FU/folinic acid compared to those patients who received 5-FU/folinic acid alone. Liposomal irinotecan has been found to show an improved distribution into tumour tissue in comparison to irinotecan, and this may have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Docetaxel is standardly used as a second-line treatment option in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on primary etoposide-platinum combination therapy. Therefore this drug could also have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma as the biology of the disease is similar to small cell lung cancer.

Specifically, in order to observe the effect of AGE content on the results, diabetic patients who are followed up and who know the principles of low glycaemic index and glycaemic load nutrition suitable for diabetic patients, who do not have additional diseases and who do not smoke were selected.

Three CYP2C19 variants (CYP2C19\*2, \*3, \*17) were genotyped and the patients were classified into three clopidogrel metabolizer groups inferred from the CYP2C19 genotypes: extensive (EM: \*1/\*1), intermediate (IM: \*1/\*2 or \*1/\*3), and poor (PM: \*2/\*2, \*2/\*3, or \*3/\*3). The CYP2C19\*17 carriers were excluded from the analysis. The antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel were assessed by Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet aggregation and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, expressed as VASP index. The endpoint was the composite incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, revascularization, other thromboembolic disease, or cardiovascular death during 2 years of follow-up.",['clopidogrel'],['clopidogrel']

NCT04805216,"The UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted temporary authorisation to three Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020 and January 2021.

These vaccinations include:

* Covid-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine);
* ChAdOx1-S vaccine (Astra Zeneca vaccine);
* Covid-19 mRNA vaccine (Moderna vaccine).

Any other Covid-19 vaccines approved for use by the MHRA in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients are to be included in this study. The above vaccines have received temporary authorisation after placebo-controlled phase 3 studies confirmed their safety and efficacy in over 100,000 volunteers. People who were immunocompromised or were receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunoglobulin treatment were excluded from these studies. Safety, efficacy, and durability of antibody response in these studies has been assessed for up to 14 weeks only. These vaccines are being rolled out in the UK and have been recommended for use for immunosuppressed individuals including patients undergoing chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and those who have undergone stem cell transplantation. Though the MHRA has approved vaccination for immunocompromised patients there is no published evidence to confirm safety and efficacy in these patients. The durability of antibody response and whether this is affected by concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy treatment is also unknown.

This observational study aims to evaluate the immune response to Covid-19 vaccines in haematology patients who have immune suppression either due to disease, treatment, or both. The investigators plan to measure Anti-SARS-COV2 IgG antibody levels at 3-5 time points 30 days apart after patients have received their 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The investigators will also collect any adverse events reported by patient including Covid-19 infection or disease after vaccination.

The study plans to recruit 50 haematology patients who are clinically assessed by a haematologist as immunosuppressed due to their disease, treatment, or both. The study also plans to recruit 30 healthy (immunocompetent) volunteers who would be the control group for comparison of antibody response and durability.","['Covid-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine', 'Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine', 'ChAdOx1-S vaccine', 'Astra Zeneca vaccine', 'Covid-19 mRNA vaccine', 'Moderna vaccine']","['', '', '', '', '', '']"
NCT00474201,"This study will determine whether the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra (Trademark)), which is used to treat HIV disease, lowers blood levels of the lipid-regulating drug gemfibrozil (Lopid (Trademark)) in HIV-negative healthy volunteers. Many patients with HIV infection who take protease inhibitors have abnormally high lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). Gemfibrozil, commonly used to treat high triglycerides, often is not effective in HIV-infected patients taking protease inhibitors, possibly because of an interaction between the two medicines that causes a lowering of gemfibrozil's levels in the blood. Results from this study will give researchers information on whether lopinavir/ ritonavir affects the blood levels of gemfibrozil.

Healthy, normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years old who test negative for HIV may be eligible for this study.

On study day 1, subjects have a blood sample drawn from a catheter inserted into a vein in the arm to determine pre-dosing blood levels of gemfibrozil. They then take a gemfibrozil tablet and are given breakfast 30 minutes after taking the drug. Blood samples are obtained through the catheter at 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing to determine gemfibrozil levels at those intervals. At the end of 12 hours, the catheter is removed and the subject is discharged from the clinic. The next morning subjects return to the clinic for another blood sample, collected through a vein in the arm.

Subjects begin taking lopinavir/ ritonavir between 7 and 35 days after their first dose, depending on their schedule and the clinic schedule. On the fourteenth day of dosing subjects come to the clinic and are given a single dose of gemfibrozil, as on study day 1, and have breakfast 30 minutes later. Blood samples are collected to determine gemfibrozil levels just like on study days 1 and 2.

NCT05917730,"Purpose:

Domestic violence (DV) is a mental health problem that affects children and adolescents. Widespread evidence suggests that witnessing DV has physical and mental health consequences. 19% of children and adolescents cared for in Children, and Youth Mental Health Centers in Catalonia declare having witnessed DV between their parents. However, there are low specialized therapeutic tools to intervene effectively. In this line, the research team of the current project adapted and manualized a group treatment designed to treat children and adolescents between 8 and 16 years old witnesses of DV on an outpatient basis called: 'Manual of Emotional Regulation and Interpersonal Abilities group Therapy - MERITA'. The treatment main aim is to improve the emotional regulation and interpersonal skills of children and adolescents who have witnessed DV. We carried out a pilot study of MERITA (Lacasa et al., 2016) where we obtained promising results. Now, we want to carry out this study to improve methodological limitations by increasing the sample size. We have added a waiting list for assigning patients in different arms (MERITA intervention vs. treatment as usual as control group), as well as we improved the assessment (pre, post, and follow-ups) using several scales with good psychometric properties.

Aims:

The aim of this trial is twofold: firstly, to assess the effectiveness of Emotional Regulation and Interpersonal Abilities group Therapy (MERITA) in children and adolescents who are witnesses of DV and treated at the Infant and dolescent mental health center (TAU); and secondly, to analyze the differences (MERITA vs only TAU) on traumatic, depressive and anxious symptomatology, emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, somatic complaints, prosocial behavior, attachment, and family functioning. Specifically, MERITA will be compared to TAU alone (post and 3-month follow-up).

These deficits could be related to alteration of sensory feedback, and could influence the ability to modulate patients' motor performance.

To date, there are not studies investigatin the ability to modulate the motor performance in patients with TKR compared to healthy age-matched subjects.

In this study 20 patients with TKR and 20 healthy will be included . Inclusion criteria are: age between 40 and 80 , TKR for primary knee osteoarthritis, knee flexion ≥ 90° and complete knee extension, ability to perform a sit to stand on a 46 cm high chair and to walk for at least 50 meters without aids. Exclusion criteria: patients undergoing TKR after traumas, previous tibial or femoral osteotomy, partial or complete revision surgery. subjects with psychiatric and/or cognitive impairments, or with neurological, musculoskeletal or other disorders that could influence motor or functional recovery will be also exluded.

NCT00511121,"This is a phase II multicenter, open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility (tolerance, compliance and safety) of a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI 571 (GLIVEC, Novartis Pharma) with a pegylated \*-Interferon 2b (PEG INTRON). The rationale for testing this combination is that 1) aIFN is curently the first line agent for the treatment of CML, 2) the pegylated formulation of aIFN is more convenient and is better tolerated than the conventional formulation, 3) STI571 is currently the most promising investigational agent for the treatment of CML because it is targeted to the molecular bases of the disease, is effective also in the advanced phases of the disease, and is effective also in the cases who are resistant to aIFN, 4) the mechanisms of action of the two agents are different. Therefore the combination of STI571 and PEGINTRON is likely to provide the best treatment of CML and to be tested very soon in randomized phase III studies of efficacy. So far STI571 and PEGINTRON have been investigated separately. The present study is an exploratory study that has been planned with the aim of evaluating the adverse events and the safety of the combination, so as to identify a safe and tolerable regime that can be tested prospectively for efficacy in a subsequent, randomized phase III study. Based on available knowledge and data, STI571 is more specific and can be more effective than PEGINTRON. Therefore in this exploratory study STI571 is given a priority over PEGINTRON as to dose and dose adaptation. Sixty subjects with chronic phase CML, previously untreated with any one of study drugs, will be enrolled over a 3 months period and will be treated and studied for 12 months. The patients can be pretreated with hydroxyurea , whenever required, hence are treated with STI 571 at a fixed dose (400mg) and with PEG-Intron at doses ranging from 50 to 150 \*g weekly (the first cohort of 20 patients at 50 \*g/w, the second cohort of 20 patients at 100 \*g/w and the third cohort of 20 patients at 150 \*g/w).

NCT06161311,"Myopia has become a world concern and its prevalence has increased in recent decades. Myopic defocus has been applied for slowing down the axial elongation and myopia progression, which is mainly based on the theory of simultaneous competing defocus and peripheral optics. Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) spectacle lenses impose myopic defocus in the central or peripheral retina, with myopia progression being retarded by 50% to 60%. However, the optimal amount of myopic defocus has not yet been determined. Relative peripheral refraction (RPR) is used to indicate the difference between peripheral refraction and central refraction. Previous studies showed that retinal shape determined RPR, and baseline RPR may influence the myopia control efficacy using DIMS lenses on myopic children. It is still unclear if any other unknown factor influenced the final myopia control outcome in these young children with myopic RPR at baseline. Unlike our previous study8 that bias on hyperopic RPR children (myopic RPR, n = 27; hyperopic RPR, n = 52), this study is a case-control study with the same sample size for each RPR group. We will also include younger children who are more prone to have myopic RPR and develop high myopia. The results should provide new insight into the myopia control strategy in early-onset myopic children.

In the current study, we will investigate the influence of baseline RPR in myopia retardation using DIMS lenses among young myopic children.

This will ba a 1-year prospective clinical trial. Through G\*Power (version 3.1.9.6) calculation, 80 healthy myopic subjects (40 myopic RPR vs 40 hyperopic RPR) aged 5-9 years should be needed.

All eye examinations will be carried out in the Optometry Research Centre (A137), the School of Optometry, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The main data collection, including refractive error, axial length, related ocular parameters will be measured at baseline, 6-month and 1-year visits. At the lens dispensing and 2-week follow-up visits, vision acuity testing and computer scanning of posterior eyes will be measured. New DIMS lens will be replaced and upgraded if the equivalent sphere of refraction (SER) is changed or visual acuity change.

The following data will be statistically analyzed. The primary outcome data include the difference in change in SER with cycloplegia between the myopic and hyperopic RPR from the baseline over 12 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes data include the changes in axial length, peripheral refraction, relative peripheral refraction, the amplitude of accommodation, lag of accommodation, corneal curvature, phoria and stereoacuity.",['DIMS lenses'],['']

- Ferumoxytol is an approved iron replacement therapy agent that has some potential for use as a contrast agent in imaging studies of the lymph system, especially involving lymph nodes that have been affected by cancer. Ferumoxytol is taken up by normal lymph nodes, but excluded from cancerous lymph node tissue. Because Ferumoxytol has not yet been approved for use as an imaging agent, researchers are interested in testing its effectiveness as a contrast agent for studies of normal lymph tissue and cancer tissue in lymph nodes of individuals with prostate cancer.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Ferumoxytol as a contrast agent in individuals who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery to treat prostate cancer.

Eligibility:

- Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and are scheduled to have surgery to remove the prostate and surrounding lymph nodes.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies.
* Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to provide baseline images for the study.
* Participants will receive an injection of Ferumoxytol and will return for another MRI scan on the following day (around 24 hours later).
* Some participants may have a third MRI scan 48 hours after the initial injection of Ferumoxytol. This third MRI scan is optional and not required by the study.

A second aim is to assess the direct contribution of cortical lesions - independent of WM injury - on the diffuse grey matter damage.

Thirty MS patients will be included in the six months after the first clinical episode of multiple sclerosis for a monocentric transversal MRI study at 7T to assess cortical MS injury. Clinical (EDSS) and neuropsychological assessments will be performed in the population the same day of a multi-parametric MRI. MRI protocol is designed to increase the detection rate of CL using multiple contrasts at high isotropic resolution (600µm3) on a whole brain exploration. Thus, MRI acquisition will include MP2RAGE, T2\*, FLAIR and DIR as previously published but also recent MRI technique like FLAWS, focusing on the grey matter by attenuating the white matter and CSF signal. Finally, QSM sequences will be performed. QSM measures tissue magnetic susceptibility mostly influenced by iron, myelin and calcium content in the brain. Due to physical properties of the technique (bipolarity), we suppose that high resolution QSM will be more sensitive that previous used sequences to depict cortical lesions. Using this multi-contrast approach with relevant MRI sequence and with a high resolution whole brain exploration might improve the detection of CL in early MS.

Furthermore, MRI protocol allow us to estimate neuronal loss (T1 relaxation time), myelin and iron content (QSM and T2\* relaxation time) within and outside cortical lesions in GM.

New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a common complication of solid-organ transplantation, and is a strong predictor of graft failure and cardiovascular mortality in the transplant population. Risk factors for NODAT in transplant recipients are similar to those in non-transplant patients, but transplant-specific risk factors such as hepatitis C (HCV) infection, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors play a dominant role in NODAT pathogenesis. The predominant factor for causing NODAT by corticosteroids seems to be the aggravation of insulin resistance; however several studies have displayed deleterious effects on insulin secretion and β-cells. Thus, adjusting the immunosuppressant regimen to improve glucose tolerance must be measured and defined from long term perspective.

NCT05290584,"Background: Early childhood is the most critical and rapid period of complete and healthy physical and cognitive development in human life. Executive function appears in early childhood and develops rapidly through complex coaction between environment and developmental processes. The preschool period is also characterized by a rapid growth in fundamental movement skills, physical activity and physical fitness. The scientific research on the relationship between fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function in preschoolers remains to be explored.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship between fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function in preschool children while controlling for potential confounding variables, examine the prospective influence (independent and interactive role) of preschooler's fundamental movement skills, physical activity and physical fitness on executive function, observe the preschoolers' fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function changes with age, and investigate gender and age differences in preschoolers' fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function.

Method: The proposed study consists of two phases, phase 1 is a cross-sectional study. Five hundred and five children aged 3-5 years will be recruited. The Test of Gross Motor Development Third Edition (TGMD-3) was used to assess children's fundamental movement skills. Preschool children's physical activity was monitored by accelerometer ActiGraph GT3X-BT. Physical fitness was tested using handgrip, 4\*10m shuttle run, 20m shuttle run, 30s sit-ups, sit and reach, and balance beam.

Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer worldwide. Compared to lung cancer in smokers, lung cancer in never-smokers is associated with East Asian ethnicity, female sex, and adenocarcinoma histology. This unique risk group is likely to have distinct molecular drivers, especially EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations.In National Taiwan Cancer Registry data, more than half (53%) of all newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and 93% of female patients are lifelong never-smokers. This scenario is common in East Asia. It is essential to develop a different strategy for screening lung cancer patients with other high-risk profiles. Several risk factors have been identified in never-smoking lung cancer and one of the most important factor is a lung cancer family history (LCFH) in a first-degree relative. Other high-risk occupational or environmental factors include air-pollution exposed occupations (such as traffic policeman and street cleaners) for at least 10 years, cooking index ≥ 110, defined as 2/7 \* days cooking by pan frying, stir frying, or deep frying in one week \* years cooking, cooking without using ventilation, passive smoke exposure, and history of pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders.

A well designed clinical study is warranted to fully assess the performance of GastroPanel examination in detecting the gastric lesions which can lead to GC. The investigators aim to perform a clinical study in an adult population in United Kingdom in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the GastroPanel test in evaluating AG and other specific gastric conditions associated with an increased risk for GC. Methods: Two hundred and fifty patients (45 years and older, both genders) will be enrolled among the patients with dyspepsia referred for gastroscopy at Homerton University Hospital (London, United Kingdom). During the same visit, all patients are subjected to gastroscopy examination, with directed biopsies from the antrum and corpus, following the protocol of the operative link on gastritis assessment (OLGA) classification for chronic gastritis and Sydney Classification. Biopsies are examined at the Pathology laboratory of Homerton University Hospital and interpreted using the OLGA staging system as well as the Sydney system for classification of gastritis.

NCT06221735,"Introduction: The large reservoir of tuberculosis infections is a key driver of sustained tuberculosis (TB) incidence. Accurate diagnostic tests are crucial to correctly identify and treat people with TB infection, which is vital to eliminate TB globally. The Cy-TB skin test and STANDARD F TB-Feron FIA (TB-Feron) fluorescent immunoassay are two newly developed TB infection tests, which could offer quality and cost advantages over other commercially available TB infection tests, especially the standard TST test. Both tests have a higher sensitivity and specificity than the currently most used tuberculin skin test. The proposed study aims to evaluate the performance of these two tests for the diagnosis of TB infection, compared with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay.

Methods and analysis: This diagnostic accuracy study will employ a cross-sectional, observational design that aims to assess the accuracy of the Cy-TB and TB-Feron tests for diagnosing TB infection, using the QFT-Plus assay as the reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity will be reported. Three different cohorts of study participants will be recruited: Adults with microbiologically-confirmed pulmonary TB (n=100); Household contacts\* of people with TB (n=200) and negative controls\*\* (n=50). All participants will be examined with Cy-TB, TB-Feron, and QFT-Plus.

It is known that METS plays a role in the development of many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's. Studies have revealed that neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, abnormal lipid metabolism and impaired vascularization, which play a role in the pathogenesis of MetS, affect the structure of the brain and cognition. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery, increased brain atrophy and white matter damage are potential explanatory mechanisms that lead to an impact on cognitive skills in patients with MetS. In addition, the existence of MetS components such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension alone also negatively affects cognitive functions, and the level of cognitive influence also increases as the number of components an individual has increases.

The literature reports that learning, executive functions, processing speed, attention/working memory and global cognitive functions are affected in individuals with MetS, but no consensus has been reached on this issue. Some studies say that MetS causes a significant decrease in cognitive functions, while some studies indicate that this difference is not significant.

Recently, the investigators have conducted the first longitudinal follow-up of R2\* (1.5 T MRI), which showed a rapid R2\* increase in both parts of the SN and in the caudal putamen. We propose, here, a multicenter prospective study of one-year cohort follow-up of R2\* variations (ΔR2\*) in three regions of interest (ROIs) (the SN, the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and the Putamen) of 160 patients with PD, using a 3 Tesla MRI, to evaluate the potential interest of R2\* as a biomarker of disease progression. The variation of R2\* (ΔR2\*) will be correlated with clinical markers of disease progress, non-motor symptoms. 80 healthy controls subjects will also be included to assess the effect of aging on cerebral physiological iron levels.",['MRI'],['']

NCT06442995,"Peri-medullary anesthesia is the preferred anesthetic technique for Caesarean surgery. Compared with general anesthesia, it reduces maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, as well as postoperative pain. However, this technique exposes the patient to the adverse effects of peri-medullary morphine, particularly the risk of postoperative urinary retention. Urinary retention during the first 72 hours after Caesarean section affects around 33% of parturients.

This is a particularly debilitating event for parturients, exposing them to the risk of further urinary catheterization, increased theoretical risk of urinary tract infection, traumatic urethral injury, hindered accelerated rehabilitation and altered maternal satisfaction.

Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of adding magnesium sulfate to epidural anesthesia for Caesarean sections, notably by reducing postoperative pain.

Magnesium sulfate may also have a facilitating effect on postoperative micturition, thanks to its sympathicolytic effect.

This hypothesis is supported by a retrospective study carried out in our maternity hospital, which showed a 15% reduction in post-Caesarean urinary retention when women were given magnesium sulfate in addition to the drugs traditionally used for epidurals.

NCT01688232,"Medical and Scientific Background: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the leading cancers in both genders. This cancer is of prognostic severity. The prognosis of this cancer has not been significantly improved. The treatment of colonic cancer is primarily based on surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy is proposed for metastatic cancers (stages III and IV). However nearly 30% of patients with localized cancer (stage II) will present a recurrence. Despite intense research efforts, no markers of sufficient prognostic value (independent of TNM) are available to identify this group of patients and justify intensified therapy. The natural history of cancer involves interactions between the tumor and the immune system of the host. The immune infiltration at the tumor site may be indicative of host response. We showed that the density of intratumor memory T cells (CD45RO) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8) in tumor regions (the core and the invasive margin) influenced the occurrence of early events of metastasis (tumor emboli) and was strongly associated with prognosis of patients with CRC (Pagès et al, NEJM-2005). This immune criterion was a better predictor of survival than the ""gold standard"" histoprognostic data of tumor invasion (T stage and N) and allowed to identify a group of patients at high risk of recurrence (\*2). The availability of this immune criterion in clinical practice could improve the prognostic assessment of patients and better guide the therapeutic. A dedicated platform has been implemented in our hospital to speed up the transfer of this immune investigation into the clinic. The investigation takes into account the density of immune cell populations in tumor regions (the core and the invasive front of the tumor). This methodology has been validated for the markers CD45RO, CD3 and CD8 and leads to the creation of an immune score (""immunoscore"" ranging from IO to I4). We validated the prognostic impact of the immunoscore in a retrospective series of 250 colorectal cancers. The main objective of this multicentric prospective clinical study is to assess in clinical practice the ""immunoscore"" and measure its prognostic value. The cohort study will include 400 patients with CRC stage I to IV (6 centers for inclusion; Paris-HEGP, Dijon, Bobigny-Avicenne, Besancon, Poitiers, Rouen). Two years of inclusion and a follow-up of 3 years for each patient will be performed (co-financing for data collection during the 4th and 5th year planned). For each patient, the pathologist of the center will send to the immunomonitoring platform of HEGP tissue sections from a paraffin block containing the tumor regions. The investigations will combine a step of immunostaining for CD3, CD8, and CD45RO (Ventana automate) markers, high-resolution scanning of the stained slides and quantification of digital images by an imaging module developed by our group from the program of Developer XD of Définiens company. The immunoscore will be calculated and the score will be correlated to the clinical data for the relapse and the survival. The secondary objective of this program is to evaluate the prognostic performance of the immune infiltrate on the biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. This study will be conducted on patients of the cohort whose biopsies were performed in the same hospital than surgery and whose samples are available in pathology laboratories involved (representing 50% of cases). For the same patients will be conducted a genetic investigation of the tumor to assess the MSI status, the presence of a K-Ras and BRAF mutations. This investigation will be performed on tumor sections from the same tumor block selected for the immunohistochemical analyses. The sections will be processed by the Department of Biology, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou. The prognostic performance of the immune investigations performed on tumor sections and biopsies will be compared to that of genetic features of the tumor. Finally, a questionnaire will be sent every six months along the monitoring of the patients to obtain information concerning (i) the emergence of an immune disorder (such as allergy, autoimmunity, inflammatory process) and (ii) the psychological status of the patients. The potential impact of such parameters during the course of the disease on the prediction of the relapse and survival obtained with the immunoscore performed at the time of surgery will be evaluated. Expected results : This prospective study is an indispensable step for the clinical validation of the prognostic value of the immunoscore. The secondary objectives should help to precise the benefit of a concomitant analysis of the biopsy, the genetic features of the tumor. The questionnaire should help to identify the clinical parameters to track along the monitoring","['CD3', 'CD8', 'CD45RO', 'K-Ras', 'BRAF']","['', '', '', '', '']"

NCT02350530,"BACKGROUND:

For patients with liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), complete resection of liver metastases is the only potentially curative treatment. The current goal of medical treatment for colorectal cancer with initially unresectable liver metastases is to maximize the rate of secondary resection and prolong overall survival (OS). A strong correlation was found between response rate and secondary resection rate of metastases, and the triple drugs combination of infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOXIRI) was recommended can be used in selected patients with potentially resectable metastases in order to improve response rate and make resection more possible. The addition of a anti-VEGFs monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to increase response rate, resection rate and improve OS in the first-line treatment of mCRC patients. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in addition to triplet drugs were previously tested in OLIVIA trial, the resection rate of liver metastases of 49% was reported, and the response rate was 81%; most common grade 3-4 adverse events was neutropenia. On the basis of such promising results, we conducted the present randomized study to explore whether FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared with FOLFOXIRI alone as first-line treatment could improve radical resectability in patients with RAS mutation-type, unresectable liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of the FOBULM study is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared to FOLFOXIRI alone in patients with initially unresectable liver-limited RAS mutation-type mCRC.

Secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment, efficacy in terms of objective response rate (ORR), OS, progression free survival (PFS), quality of life and an assessment of biomarkers for predictive response and prognosis.","['5-fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', 'irinotecan', 'oxaliplatin', 'FOLFOXIRI', 'bevacizumab']","['fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', 'irinotecan', 'oxaliplatin', '', 'bevacizumab']"

There is a combination of chemotherapy drugs often used to treat gastrointestinal cancer, which consists of 5-FU (fluorouracil), leucovorin (leucovorin calcium), irinotecan and oxaliplatin and is known as ""FOLFIRINOX"". FOLFIRINOX is a current drug therapy combination (or regimen) used for people with advanced pancreatic cancer, although this combination is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication. FOLFIRINOX was recently shown in a separate clinical trial to increase survival compared to another commonly used drug in pancreatic cancer called gemcitabine.

NCT03537833,"Pemetrexed is a multi-folate inhibitor approved in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pleural mesothelioma. Its toxicity profile is mainly hematologic (anemia, neutropenia and thrombopenia) and can be limiting when \> grade 2 according to NCI-CTCAE criteria. First clinical trials highlighted hematologic toxicity, especially anemia, which was reduced by decreasing pemetrexed dosage from 600 to 500 mg/m² Q3W and by adding systematic vitamin supplementation (B9/B12). Despite this, incidence of hematological toxicity remains frequent with anemia occurring in more than 20% of patients treated by pemetrexed in combination. Methotrexate, a well-known antineoplastic drugs used in several cancer and non-cancer disease conditions can also induced severe hematologic toxicity in case of methotrexate-reduced elimination and, as a consequence, its accumulation. For example, the elimination of methotrexate is mediated by tubular secretion through type 1 and type 3 organic anion transport (hOAT1 and hOAT3). Association with drugs that inhibits hOATs can induced a hematological toxicity caused by methotrexate accumulation. Among these, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to inhibit hOATs. The drug interaction that results from their combination with methotrexate is clinically relevant and lead to an increased hematological toxicity. However, hypothetical drug interaction between PPIs and pemetrexed is unknown while pemetrexed seems to be mostly eliminated by hOAT3 (11-fold higher than methotrexate). One study revealed lansoprazole to inhibits in vitro hOAT3. This same study investigates in a retrospective chart patients treated by pemetrexed and the study found a significant association between combination with PPI and hematological toxicity by pemetrexed. Unfortunately this study lacks of relevant methodology and suffered from its retrospective chart. This potential drug interaction must be a real concern for oncologists and clinical pharmacists.

NCT05789251,"Dunnigan's syndrome is a partial familial lipodystrophy due to a mutation in the Lamine A LMNA gene. This very rare syndrome is 20 times more common in Réunion compared to the rest of Europe with several families suffering from a unique variant of LMNA, the p.(Thr655Asnfs\*49) variant known as the ""Reunion variant"", the appearance of which in Reunion dates back to the 17th century. This variant is expressed in homozygous and heterozygous form and has only been identified in subjects from Reunion. Clinically, patients with Dunnigan's have an absence of subcutaneous fatty tissue which mainly affects the lower part of the body and leads to severe insulin resistance responsible for early diabetes. To detect these metabolic complications as early as possible, an annual follow-up of the subjects is recommended with the performance of an OGTT test annually in non-diabetic subjects. This problem is identical for patients with cystic fibrosis leading to the same recommendation. However, whether in our experience of monitoring patients with Dunningan's lipodystrophy, in subjects at risk of diabetes or in subjects with cystic fibrosis, the OGTT test and even more so its repetition is poorly accepted, which can lead to lack of patient follow-up. An alternative solution to the OGTT is therefore justified.

In the literature, different avenues have been explored. First, given oral glucose intolerance, replacement with a standardized breakfast has been explored in several studies. Another alternative tested in the population of subjects with cystic fibrosis is the use of an interstitial glucose sensor for screening for carbohydrate abnormalities.

In view of the literature, we formulate several hypotheses that will be tested in our study:

1. The intake of a standardized breakfast containing 75g of carbohydrates is comparable to the ingestion of 75g of glucose on the result of the OGTT test at 120 min for the diagnosis of carbohydrate abnormalities (diabetes and prediabetes) in patients with Dunnigan's lipodystrophy.
2. The continuous recording of interstitial glycaemia over several days allows the diagnosis of glucidic abnormalities equivalent to the classic OGTT in this population; possibly by identifying glycemic variations not seen by a single OGTT test. Thus the installation of an interstitial sensor over several days could be an alternative to the realization of the OGTT in the identification of carbohydrate disorders in patients with Dunnigan's lipodystrophy.
3. There will be a similar profile but a time lag between venous glycemic curves and interstitial blood glucose measurements after OGTT.
4. Replacing the oral glucose load of the classic OGTT (gold standard) with a standardized carbohydrate breakfast leads to similar interstitial glycaemia curves but with a time lag.","['Lamine A', 'LMNA']","['', '']"

NCT01977963,"Thionamides, the antithyroid drugs, have been widely used to treat hyperthyroidism1. Side effects are found in 1% - 5% of the patients1. One of the most serious side effect is agranulocytosis, which occurs in 0.1% - 0.3 % of the patients1. This might lead to severe infection and sometimes mortality. The underlying mechanism is unclear. An immune phenomenon may be involved because the antigranulocyte antibodies or lymphocyte sensitized to antithyroid drugs are found in these patients6,7. The recognition of major histocompatibility complex class II peptide complexes by T lymphocytes is central to the development of immune response. According to a report in 1996, the HLA DRB1\*08032 allele is strongly associated with susceptibility to methimazole-induced agranulocytosis20.

Recently, there are new techniques for genetics study. We aimed to identify the associated genetic change of the agranulocytosis side effect of antithyroid drugs. First, we will look at the classical human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) loci, such as HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ and -DP. If no significant change is found in the above genes, we will consider whole exon sequencing with next-generation sequencing, Statistic analysis will include appropriate linkage analysis, association study, variation data analysis, pathway analysis. If we can identify the genetic change and perform genetic examinations before prescription, we can avoid the happening of severe side effects.","['Thionamides', 'methimazole']","['', 'thiamazole']"

NCT01317277,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a debilitating and frequently abused substance that is often comorbid with HIV infection. HIV+ persons with current METH abuse or dependence (HIV+/METH+) have several characteristics, in addition to their substance use, that make them particularly susceptible to nonadherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) including elevated rates of neurocognitive impairment, co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders, and unstable living situations. The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address these potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further develop and refine a personalized, automated, real-time, mobile phone, text messaging intervention (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+ persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/METH+ persons; and 3) To examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data collected over the study. In order to realize these aims, the investigators will leverage the infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success, impact, and innovation: 1) the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which is a NIDA-funded center that focuses on the combined effects of METH and HIV infection, and 2) the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), which conducts research on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially, the investigators will refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and tailored to the needs of HIV+/METH+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once refined, the proposed iTAB intervention will use text messages that are automated, scalable, personalized, interactive, flexible, and motivating. The investigators will assess the acceptability and effectiveness of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e., MEMS caps) over a 6-week period via a pilot RCT with 40 HIV+/METH+ assigned to the iTAB intervention and 20 HIV+/METH+ assigned to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of nonadherence including frequency of METH use, neuropsychological impairment, and mood will be examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate for these factors associated with nonadherence as compared to CTRL.

However, in primary care, little is known about how many COPD patients have suboptimal PIFR. Furthermore, there is a paucity of knowledge concerning the associations of PIFR, inhalation technique and medication adherence with the effectiveness of maintenance therapy.

Objective: To examine associations of PIFR, inhalation technique, and medication adherence with health status and disease, exacerbations, and healthcare resource utilization in patients with COPD receiving maintenance treatment with dry powder inhalers.

Study design: Cross-sectional observational study in five European countries\*.

Study population: COPD patients aged 40 years or older who have received COPD maintenance therapy through DPIs in the past 3 months or longer.

Main study parameters: Health status as measured with the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), number of exacerbations, an assessment of PIFR, inhalation technique errors, medication adherence, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), medication use and demographic and clinical covariates.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: No significant burden from participating is expected. Risk of participating is deemed negligible. In addition, patients may benefit from participating.

Severe psoriasis is a disabling disease affecting the physical and emotional well being of patients, and its effect on quality of life is similar to that seen with other major medical diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Lately, it is increasingly being recognized that psoriasis is not merely a skin disease but is probably associated with other co-morbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, the metabolic syndrome and cardio-vascular diseases (CVD). The metabolic syndrome is a combination of diabetes mellitus type II (or insulin resistance), hypertension, central obesity, and combined hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL; decreased HDL; elevated triglycerides). As the literature linking psoriasis and the metabolic syndrome expands, also reports of an increased rate of CVD mortality in psoriasis patients accumulates. These data emphasize that metabolic dysregulations are the leading risk factors for occlusive vascular events and early death in patients with severe psoriasis. Progress in understanding the pathogenesis of these apparently diverse diseases has discovered that low-grade systemic inflammation might be the common physiological pathway that may provide the biological plausibility of the associations discovered in the epidemiological studies.

NCT06417138,"Comparative effectiveness of different drugs used to treat patients in Rheumatoid Arthritis Saudi database (RASD)

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease-causing significant disability among patients(1). The prevalence rate of RA varies based on the geographical locations, however, several reviews reported a global prevalence rate of 0.5-1.1% with an annual incidence rate of 20-50 cases per 100 000 of the American and North European population(1,2). Of this population, the World Health Organization reports that 50% will not be able to hold a sustainable job after 10 years of diagnosis . In Saudi Arabia, recent and generalisable epidemiological data regarding RA in Saudi Arabia are limited and suboptimal(1). One study by Al Dalaan et al in 1998, that was conducted in Al-Qassim region reported that the prevalence rate of RA is about 0.2%(3).

In patients with RA, early diagnosis was found to halt the ailment's relentless progression to joint destruction which carried a detrimental effect on the patient's functional and psychological state (4). However, the international lag time from the onset of symptoms until the initiation of treatment in patients with RA has been collectively calculated to be around almost one year time (5).

Diseases modifying anti rheumatic agents (DMARDS) are the main drugs used for the management of RA, and it mainly reduce the inflammation and improve the outcomes(6). Several DMARSs drugs are available for the management of RA, however, recently, biological DMARDS have also been widely used and recommended in case the conventional DMARDS fail to control the diseases(6,7). Worldwide, there have been multiple studies that examined the effectiveness of DMARDS and bDMARDS drugs for the management of RA, this include large controlled trials which are the gold standard method for investigating medications efficacy(8,9). However, observational real-world data to examine the effectiveness of these medications is also important and can be more generalizable, have longer follow up and can examine different characteristics. Previous observational studies investigating the effectiveness of DMARDS and bDMARDS were mainly in Europe and North America which does not necessarily represent the current situation and the characteristics of the middle eastern population(10,11), as there is so much variability in access to different biological drugs in different countries. In addition, these studies did not compare treatment lines. In the middle east there were limited studies that addressed the effectiveness of different drugs used to treat RA in Saudi Arabia(5,12-14). These studies were mainly cross sectional in nature or reviews, and it is difficult to draw any conclusions with such study designs. Therefore, this research is to compare the effectiveness of multiple DMARDS medication for the treatment of RA patients in Saudi Arabia.

Literature Review

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease that causes irreversible joint deformities which can have debilitating effects on a patient's overall wellbeing. RA has a global prevalence rate of 0.5-1.1% with an annual incidence rate of 20-50 cases per 100 000 of the American and North European population (1). Of this population, the World Health Organization reports that 50% will not be able to hold a sustainable job after 10 years of diagnosis. RA is strongly associated with the female gender, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 to 3:1. Smoking habits have also been shown to both increase the risk of acquiring RA and of worsening its prognosis(1,15).

Early diagnosis was found to halt the ailment's relentless progression to joint destruction which carried a detrimental effect on the patient's functional and psychological state. A study found that only 31% of RA patients visited a rheumatologist within less than 12 weeks of symptom onset, those who did had ameliorated progression rates at 6 years as measured by the Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) as well as higher rates of DMARD-free remission than patients who delayed their presentation to more than 12 weeks (16) Even though the importance of optimal treatment has been demonstrated, in Africa and the Middle East diagnoses are often delayed for months or even years after symptom onset(5,12,17,18) Our group conducted a study in Saudi Arabia showed that patients may not receive a diagnosis of RA for up to 30 months after the onset of symptoms (12). Raising public awareness of RA and treatment options is also an important tool for reducing time to diagnosis(17). Public education programs can lead to earlier diagnosis and initiation of therapy, as observed in patients in the United Arab Emirates(19). Increased public awareness may also lead to patients with symptoms of RA visiting rheumatology clinics rather than other specialties, thereby receiving adequate and timely treatment.

NCT02782936,"Background: The gas mask is used to protect military and non-military subjects exposed to respiratory hazards (CBRN agents). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the gas mask on respiratory patterns and indexes of the respiratory effort. Methods: We are completing our study with 14 healthy subjects to evaluate breathing patterns, index of respiratory efforts and blood gases. Seven conditions have been tested in a randomized order: at rest, during effort (on a tread mill, standardized at 7 METs for all subjects) and during induced hypoxemia with and without a mask (C4, Airboss Defence, Bromont, Canada). Airway pressure, inspiratory and expiratory flows were measured. An esophageal catheter was introduced at the beginning of the study to measure esophageal pressure (Peso) and calculate indexes of respiratory effort (PTPeso, WOB). SpO2 was continuously measured and capillary blood bases were drawn at the end of each condition. Each condition lasted 10 minutes, data of the last 2 minutes at a steady state were considered for analyses. Results: The preliminary analyses based on 10 subjects are presented here. Comparing the wearing of the gas mask and without, most of the respiratory index increased in the tested conditions (at rest, during induced hypoxemia and during effort). At rest, in 8 out of 10 healthy subject the indexes of effort were higher with the gas mask, a statistical trend was observed with the WOB (0.22±0.13 vs. 0.28±0.10 J/cycle; p = 0.059), the PTPes (101±35 vs. 122±47 cmH2O\*s; p=0.21) and SwingPeso (4.4±2.0 vs. 5.3±2.0 cmH2O; p=0.13). During the effort, the respiratory index increased (WOB 4.0±2.6 vs. 5.6±3.2; p=0.10; PTPeso 406±211 vs. 606±65; p=0.04; SwingPeso 14.8±8.1 vs. 21.8±9.0; p=0.13). There was no difference for the breathing pattern and arterial blood gases data with and without mask. Data for induced hypoxemia are under analysis. We measured on bench the inspiratory and expiratory resistances of the tested gas mask (C4: inspiratory resistances = 3.2 cmH2O at 1 L/sec; expiratory resistances = 0.9 cmH2O at 1 L/sec). This may explain in part the increased work of breathing with masks. Conclusions: This study demonstrated an increase of the indexes of respiratory effort during an exercise with the gas mask.

Old name of CP is ""Little's disease"". In Spastic diplegic, muscle stiffness is mainly in the legs, with the arms less affected or not affected at all. There could be secondary musculoskeletal problems due to muscle weakness resulting from poor alignment, limited range of motion, and asymmetrical posture. These deformities are negatively affected by biomechanical movements and can affect balance and gait functions. The main goal of rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy is to restore independent walking. However, children with cerebral palsy have limited mobility, which leads to gait disorders (short steps, slow walking speed, increased swing phase and postural instability). Therefore, it is important to choose an effective training method to improve the balance and gait of children with cerebral palsy. Walking training can help improve muscle tone, postural control and gait function as well as improve muscle strength, endurance, and coordination of the lower extremities. A growing body of evidence supports implementing dual-task gait training for enhancing functional mobility and cognitive performance. This will be a randomized controlled trial, data will be collected from Rising Sun Institute, Mughalpura campus. A study will be conducted on 32 patients.

From a multicenter survey in China, over one third of chronic cough is caused by CVA, which is higher than western countries. CVA differs from classic asthma, usually manifesting a symptom of only coughing without wheezing or dyspnea and particularly coughing at night. With less clinical manifestation and medical intervention, CVA patients are easily be neglected and misdiagnosed, and 30-40% of them will develop to typical asthma in the next few years. Currently there's no specific therapy recommendation for CVA in GINA. Although cough guidelines in China recommend that CVA patients should be treated as typical asthma, no recommendation on details about ICS/LABA dosage and duration. There are only a few sporadic CVA therapy researches with small sample size. Two studiesfound that CVA patients can't get cough symptom relief even after treating by low dose of ICS/LABA for 3 months.

-To test the safety of the treatment and determine if it can cause the patient s tumor to shrink.

Eligibility:

* Patients greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 66 years of age whose cancer has spread beyond the original site and does not respond to standard treatment.
* Patients have tissue type human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A\*0201.
* Patients cancer cells have the ESO-1 gene.

Design:

* Workup: Patients have scans, x-rays, laboratory tests, and other tests as needed.
* Patients have leukapheresis to collect cells for laboratory treatment and later reinfusion. For this procedure, whole blood is collected thorough a tube in a vein, the desired cells are extracted from the blood, and the rest of the blood is returned to the patient.
* Chemotherapy: Patients have low-dose chemotherapy for 1 week to prepare the immune system to receive the treated lymphocytes.
* Cell infusion and aldesleukin (IL-2) treatment: Patients receive the lymphocytes by a 30-minute infusion through a vein. Starting within 24 hours of the infusion, they receive high-dose aldesleukin infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days (maximum15 doses).
* Recovery: Patients rest for 1 to 2 weeks to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and aldesleukin.
* Tumor biopsy: Patients may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor) after treatment to look at the effects of treatment on the immune cells in the tumor.
* Follow-up: After treatment is completed, patients return to the clinic once a month for several months for physical examinations, a review of side effects, laboratory tests and scans. They may undergo leukapheresis at some visits to look at the effect of treatment on the immune system and check the viability of the infused cells. Patients then return to the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinic once a year for 5 years and then complete a follow-up questionnaire for another 10 years.
* Retreatment: Patients whose tumor shrinks or disappears following treatment and then recurs may receive one additional treatment, using the same regimen of chemotherapy, lymphocyte infusion and IL-2 treatment.",['aldesleukin'],['aldesleukin']

NCT05102747,"Brain metastases (BM) are a common systemic cancer manifestation which incidence increases. Therapeutic options include whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The concept of ""oligometastatic"" cerebral disease (oligoBM) has emerged and led to consider alternative approaches. The main challenge is to preserve neurological function and independence the longest as possible.

Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment modality for selected oligoBM patients. It allows to achieve the balance of tumour destruction and normal tissue preservation by precisely and accurately delivering a very high dose of radiation in one (SRS) or a few (HSRT) fractions to a limited, well-defined volume. However, no standard exists for decision-making between SRS and HSRT and this important question is being discussed in the recent literature.

HSRT appears particularly interesting, assuming the patient convenience of few fractions, the normal tissue sparing achieved through focal irradiation, and the improved normal tissue tolerance of high dose radiation through fractionation.

Common adverse effects of SRT are rare but can occasionally be serious, notably radionecrosis that may induce neurological deficits in patients. Although SRS is often less well-tolerated, it remains the mainstay of treatment.

To investigators knowledge, SRS and HSRT have not been prospectively compared.","['whole-brain radiotherapy', 'stereotactic radiosurgery', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy', 'HSRT', 'SRS']","['', '', '', '', '']"
NCT02442297,"This study is for patients that have brain cancer. The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting immune cells present in the blood that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to tumor cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2. Many types of brain tumors are positive for HER2 . HER2 antibodies have been used to treat people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). These CAR-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors like the one these patients have, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of these T cells should help them fight cancer.

These HER2-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CAR T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this experimental intervention might help patients with brain tumors who volunteer to test this new agent.","['anti-HER2', 'chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', 'HER2-CAR T cells']","['', '', '']"

NCT01782339,"The treatment of germ cell tumours is considered to be one of the major successes in the area of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Even in patients who relapse after first line therapy, a durable remission rate of between 25% and 60% has been seen using further chemotherapy. In 1999, researchers at St Bartholomew's Hospital developed the GAMEC protocol (combination chemotherapy with filgrastim, actinomycin D, methotrexate, etoposide, cisplatin). Results from this study showed that 50% of patients with relapsed testicular cancer could be cured using this treatment. When we reviewed the individual patients it was clear that older patients (\>35yrs) or patients with a raised Lactate Dehydrogenase (a blood test that monitors cancer activity), did not do as well. In addition, patients whose original tumour started in their chest (mediastinal germ cell tumour) have tended to do badly if they relapse. We have been developing a study for patients who fulfil at least one of these criteria. The GAMIO study (filgrastim, actinomycin D, methotrexate, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) has recently closed due to problems with high levels of toxicity from the irinotecan.

We expect that this treatment with oxaliplatin will be less damaging to the kidneys than cisplatin. Both oxaliplatin and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin and irinotecan have similar activity in relapsed patients in the phase II setting. We hope to improve on our previous results with this substitution and see if this will lead to an improvement in the cure rate of relapsed germ cell tumours with poor prognosis and reduce the side effects compared to our standard treatment.

NCT06220240,"Energy availability (EA) refers to the balance between daily energy intake and exercise energy expenditure. Athletically inadequate EA is defined as low energy availability (LEA). Energy deficits occur throughout life, from young athletes with a relative lack of energy in sports or the female athlete triad to older adults struggling with weight loss. Acute and/or chronic LEA can cause negative athletic and health outcomes in athletes.

It is known that LEA, as an energy saving mechanism, suppresses the reproductive system and causes disruption of the menstrual cycle, as well as causing many interrelated endocrine-related physiological consequences by changing other hormonal pathways. Menstrual dysfunction due to LEA causes various risks as it can disrupt the EC during training and competition. Therefore, low EA may contribute to poor sports performance due to detrimental endocrine effects.

Various parameters such as body mass and nutritional intake affect the performance of athletes, and LEA is frequently reported among athletes with intense training programs. LEA combined with high training volumes; It can cause negative consequences such as impaired protein synthesis/degradation rate, impaired hormonal and training response, increased risk of fatigue, and these can lead to decreased performance. Resting metabolic rate, which indicates the energy expended for basic body functions, is considered a potential objective indicator of energy availability.

Regulation of dietary energy intake in the management of LEA in athletes covers a wide area in the literature. However, LEA is caused not only by a deficiency in energy intake but also by an excess in energy expenditure. In the light of this information, the aim of the study is to examine the acute period effects of the training program in which exercise energy expenditure is reduced in terms of energy availability and athletic performance.",[],[]

NCT03970694,"A. Background and purpose:

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced colon cancer: an open, multi-centered, randomize controlled phase 3 trial.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, the morbidity and mortality rate are both in rising trend. 10-23% newly diagnosed colon cancer is at locally advanced stage and surgically unresectable. For this subgroup, treatment guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. However, less than 50% patients could convert into R0 resectable, therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory, 5-year overall survival rate is only 12.5%-45.7%.\[JCO,2010\] Since 2006, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has been a recommendation as standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, and has been widely applied to clinical use. As for locally advanced colon cancer, it still lacks evidence to support whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a beneficial option. There are only several articles about locally advanced colon cancer undertaking neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before surgery through Pubmed research, including 3 case reports, 1 abstract and 5 clinical researches with a small sample size, 3 of which are from the investigator's study group.

The investigators recently reported clinical data about therapeutic effect of 60 unresectable locally advanced colon cancer cases and the results were exciting. According to the results, through neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, R0 resection rate is 86%, local recurrence rate is 10.2%, 3-year OS and 5-year OS are 76.7% and 66.6%, respectively. \[Onco Targets Ther, 2018\] ""Colorectal cancer diagnoses and treatment guidelines"" written by Chinses Society of Clinical Oncology (ver. 2017, 2018), suggested that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was an optional treatment strategy or secondary recommended treatment strategy. In a word, the investigators' result was referred as revisory basis of the guideline \[CJC,2016\], with a relatively low level of evidence in evidence-based medicine.

This phase 3 clinical trial mainly aims to acquire a higher level of evidence in evidence-based medicine on the subject about neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as a treatment strategy to unresectable locally advanced colon cancer, and the ultimate goal is to rewrite the International treatment guidelines of locally advanced colorectal cancer.

B. Research Content:

1. . Research Object: Patients who newly diagnosed unresectable locally advanced colon cancer. Including: 1. tumor infiltrates through the intestinal wall and adheres to tissues and organs around the colon(T4b), imaging assesses that R0 resection is unachievable. 2. Pericolonic lymph node involvement is closely adjacent to the large abdominal vessels, imaging assesses that lymphadenectomy is difficult. 3. Surgical exploration indicates that R0 resection is not achievable. 4. In initial diagnosis, surgeon evaluates the need for extensive multi-organ combined resection and expected to damage the organs, which would seriously affect the postoperative quality of life.
2. . Main research indicator: 5-year overall survival rate
3. . Secondary research indicators: 1. R0 resection rate 2. 3-year tumor-free survival rate
4. . Research groups assignment: 1. Research group: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group; 2. Control group: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy group.
5. . Sample calculation: Calculation is based on the main research indicator: 5-year survival rate. Based on α=0.05(bilateral), β=0.20(unilateral), 5-year OS improves from 45% in control group to 65% in research group, 4-year period, 5-year follow-up. Research group and control group should at least enroll 74 and 75 qualified cases, respectively, a total of 149 cases, with an expected delisting rate of 20%, the total sample size is 186, 93 cases for each group.
6. . Research protocols:

1. Research group: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy（XELOX \* 4 + radiotherapy）→ Surgery (if possible) → post-surgery chemotherapy.

NCT05792943,"Irinotecan is commonly used to treat lung, colorectal, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and other types of cancer. The main metabolic pathway of SN-38, the active product of Irinotecan, is grape glycoalkaloid acidification by UDP - glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) and then excreted through bile and urine. Clinically, Irinotecan treatment can cause many adverse reactions, and differences in UGT1A1 genotypes can lead to structural changes or functional defects in enzymes, causing reduced acidification of grape glycolaldehyde, and increasing Irinotecan side effects. Therefore, if the patient's ability to metabolize the drug can be assessed before taking the drug, it will be of great help in treatment.

Until 2021, cancer will remain the top ten causes of death in Taiwan, of which colorectal and pancreatic cancer rank third and seventh among the top ten cancers in Taiwan, respectively, and these two cancers often use complex chemotherapy including irinotecan. Routine detection of UGT1A1 genotype in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer before irinotecan treatment predicts the drug metabolism capacity of irinotecan and adjusts the dose, allowing patients receiving irinotecan to reduce the harm of side effects. At present, the UGT1A1 genotype evaluated is usually only UGT1A1\*28, but the common UGT1A1 genotype in Taiwan also has UGT1A1\*6 and UG1A1\*63, etc. There is no literature on Taiwanese cancer patients with actual irinotecan chemotherapy, so this study aims to explore the influence of the UGT1A1 genotype and develop other UGT1A1 genotype test methods.

NCT05419635,"Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent the formation of blood clots in people who have or have had:

* an irregular and often rapid heartbeat
* a blocked blood flow to the heart
* a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. When a blood clot forms in the body in patients with the above conditions, it may block vessels of the heart, the brain and/or other parts of the body. This may lead to heart attack, stroke and other serious complications.

Blood clots are formed in a process known as coagulation. This is a complex series of steps that must occur in a specific sequence. Medications are already available to prevent the formation of blood clots. They work by interrupting one or more of the coagulation steps and are therefore known as anticoagulants. They decrease the risk of the above-mentioned complications.

The study treatment asundexian works by blocking a very specific step in the blood clotting process, the activation of a protein called Factor XIa. Due to its very specific action that is not thought to be involved in the main blood clotting steps needed to stop bleeding (e.g. like from a cut finger), asundexian is expected to reduce the risk of bleeding that is still seen with existing anticoagulants. Since people who need an anticoagulant may also have liver problems, information on asundexian use in this group is needed.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how asundexian moves into, through and out of the body in participants with a mild or moderate reduction in liver function compared to participants with normal liver function who are similar in age, weight, and gender.

To answer this question, researchers will measure

* the average highest level of asundexian in the blood (also referred to as Cmax)
* the average total level of asundexian in the blood (also referred to as AUC). that were reached after intake of a single tablet of asundexian.

The researchers will compare these data between participants with reduced liver function and matched participants with normal liver function to look for differences.

* do physical examinations
* check vital signs
* take blood and urine samples
* examine heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

The pathophysiological link between increased body temperature and increased seizure susceptibility is unsolved in humans. In a mouse model it has been shown that young animals had a tendency to hyperventilate thereby causing intra-cerebral hypocapnia / alkalosis and a decrease of their seizure threshold. This effect was not observed in older animals. Redressing the pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure) by breathing carbon dioxide enriched air instantly stopped the seizures.

In this study the investigators want to investigate the respiratory physiology in children with febrile seizures and compare it to children who have fever but did not have febrile seizures.

Methods:

Investigators will measure the amount of zinc absorbed from ZnBfR compared to that absorbed from a conventional Bangladeshi rice (Diet-CR) (control). They will also compare the zinc absorption from ZnBfR with that from zinc-fortified conventional rice (Diet-CR+Z). The study will be a cross-over, randomized, controlled clinical study. Forty-four children aged 36-59 mo of either sex will be recruited from the same community as mentioned before, and participants will be individually randomized, in equal numbers, to one of the two comparison groups, A and B. During an initial one-day acclimatization period, the participants will receive the conventional rice-based diet three times a day, to confirm that participants will accept the study diets and adhere to the study procedures. On study days 2 and 4, in comparison group A, participants will receive either the Diet-ZBfR or Diet-CR based on the random assignments, and participants will receive Diet-CR or Diet ZBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2 and 4), Likewise, in comparison group B, the participants will receive either Diet-ZBfR or Diet-CR+Z on days 2 and 4 based on the random assignments, and participants will receive Diet-CR+Z or the Diet-ZBfR, respectively, on days 3 and 5 (i.e., the diet not received on days 2 and 4).

Outcome measures/variables:

Intake of total dietary zinc (TDZ) and phytate for each subject will be calculated during the clinical study. Fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) will be determined from the isotopic ratios obtained in urine samples using the following equation, which shows, as an example, the calculation that will be used for zinc absorption from the diet traced with 67Zn:

FAZ = 67Zn tracer:tracee ratio / 68Zn tracer:tracee ratio \* (68Zn dose given IV / 67Zn dose given orally)

NCT01158794,"Iron overload, which can be defined operationally as too much iron in the body, develops as a consequence of too many blood transfusions given, or due to genetic defects hereditary hemochromatosis). Iron accumulates in several organs in the body, such as the heart, liver, endocrine glands (pancreas, thyroid, etc.), and spleen. Excessive iron can damage organs and may even cause death. Iron overload needs to be appropriately monitored and treated to avoid unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

The present study, GENIOS, proposes to test prospectively the hypothesis that genetic modifiers influence the iron overload status of patients receiving transfusions. To test this hypothesis, the study will perform genetic studies to investigate possible genetic influences for iron accumulation in the body and will study iron accumulation not only in the liver, but also in the heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. In addition: the study will investigate if these same genes have any role during treatment of iron overload, in other words, if certain genetic mutations will influence how iron exits the body. This study will also investigate how substances that are known to control the trafficking of iron in and out of the body and its damaging effects to the tissues (hepcidin and non transferrin-bound iron) are linked to the accumulation of iron in the heart and liver. Iron in the body will be measured by R2\*MRI and no liver biopsies will be required. Genetic studies will be done by specialized tests using peripheral blood DNA.

Iron accumulates differently in different people and in different organs of the body. Some people accumulate iron faster than others, even when receiving the same number of blood transfusions",['hepcidin'],['']

A prior clinical trial at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) (BABYHUG, NCT01783990) demonstrated that a fixed dose (20 mg/kg/day) of hydroxyurea was safe and effective in decreasing SCA-related complications in very young children (9-18 months), and largely due to these findings, hydroxyurea is recommended to be offered to all children (≥9 months old) with SCA, independent of disease severity. Nevertheless, children in the treatment arm of BABYHUG continued to experience vaso-occlusive symptoms and to incur organ damage. In clinical trials of older children with SCA, intensification of hydroxyurea to a maximum tolerated dosage (MTD), defined by mild to moderate myelosuppression, may be associated with improved laboratory parameters compared to fixed lower-dosing, but the clinical benefits gained from dose intensification have not been described. Therefore, in this trial, children in the standard treatment arm will receive a fixed dose of hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/day), and participants in the experimental arm will receive hydroxyurea intensified to MTD, defined by a goal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1500-3000 cells/µL.

NCT01959009,"Background:

Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) remains a problem in neonatology. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) provides effective gas exchange with minimal pressure fluctuation around a continuous distending pressure and therefore small tidal volume. Animal studies showed that recruitment and maintenance of functional residual capacity (FRC) during HFOV (""open lung concept"") could reduce lung injury.

""Open lung HFOV"" is achieved by delivering a moderate high mean airway pressure (MAP) using oxygenation as a guide of lung recruitment. Some neonatologists suggest combining HFOV with recurrent sigh-breaths (HFOV-sigh) delivered as modified conventional ventilator-breaths at a rate of 3/min. The clinical observation is that HFOV-sigh leads to more stable oxygenation, quicker weaning and shorter ventilation. This may be related to improved lung recruitment. This has however to our knowledge not been tested in a clinical trial using modern ventilators.

Purpose, aims:

* To compare HFOV-sigh with HFOV-only and determine if there is a difference in oxygenation expressed as a/A-ratio and/or stability of oxygenation expressed as percentage time with oxygen saturation outside the reference range.
* To provide information on feasibility and treatment effect of HFOV-sigh to assist planning larger studies. We hypothesize that oxygenation is better during HFOV-sigh.

Methods:

Infants at 24-36 weeks corrected gestational age already on HFOV are eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to HFOV-sigh (3 breaths/min) followed by HFOV-only or vice versa for 4 alternating 1-hours periods (2-treatment, double crossover design, each patient being its own control). During HFOV-sigh set-pressure will be reduced to keep MAP constant, otherwise HFOV will remain at pretrial settings. Outcome will be calculated from normal clinical parameters including pulx-oximetry and transcutaneous monitoring of oxygen and carbon-dioxide partial pressures.","['HFOV', 'oxygen']","['', 'oxygen']"

NCT01714011,"Introduction:

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. For majority of patients it is a lifetime condition,characterized by intermittent episodes of hospitalization due to relapse or acute symptom exacerbation. The nature and course of the disorder impose significant social and economic burden. Relapse is costly, with hospitalization accounting for a substantial portion of healthcare expenses. Second generation antipsychotic side effect such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus will contribute additional costs to the treatment.

Many studies have since then provided convincing evidence for a high risk of diabetes and other glucose abnormalities, metabolic syndrome and mortality due to elevated cardiovascular risk in patients with schizophrenia.

However many studies has shown the effectiveness and safety of aripiprazole and ziprazidone.In one of the study, aripiprazole showed improvement of negative schizophrenic symptoms by 25% and 50% of functioning level from baseline. In term of safety, antipsychotics considered to have a safer metabolic profile were amisulpride, ziprasidone and aripiprazole.

Study objectives:

* To investigate the safety and efficacy of ziprazidone versus aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.
* To investigate the reversibility of metabolic syndrome and diabetes parameters following the treatment with ziprazidone versus aripiprazole.

However, despite the current widespread use of ECP in the treatment of patients with GvHD, clinical data from randomized studies is limited and small prospective and retrospective trials are the main evidence base .This is also the case for other commonly used immunosuppressant agents, which have been used in GvHD since ECP was introduced.

The systematic review concluded that ECP is an effective therapy for oral, skin, and liver SR-cGVHD, with modest activity in lung and gastrointestinal SR-cGVHD.

In the USA Ibrutinib is the only FDA approved agent for second line cGvHD therapy once steroid therapy has failed and Ruxolitinib had been approved in the USA for the treatment of steroid refractory GvHD.

While studies have shown the effectiveness and safety of ECP in GvHD treatment, there is limited data to show how it is being used in combination with the recently approved agents.

Using existing registry data targeting centres where the newer agents are being used and enhancing the capture of treatment data we believe we can undertake a larger scale study, which will include the new treatment protocols. The aim of the current study is to improve the evidence basis on the potential benefit of ECP use as treatment of GVHD.","['Extracorporeal photopheresis', 'Ibrutinib', 'Ruxolitinib']","['', 'ibrutinib', 'ruxolitinib']"

NCT04180059,"For several decades, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation (allo-HSCT) has remained an important strategy in the management of patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. The acceptance of umbilical cord blood (UCBT) and haploidentical grafts (Haplo) as viable alternative donors for allo-HSCT has increased the options for patients with no matched donors and now ensures that a donor can be identified for virtually all patients. Relapsed disease is a principal threat to these patients and affects 30-50% of them. The therapeutic options for these relapsing patients are diverse but remain largely ineffective in altering their long-term outcomes. Therefore, pre-emptive treatment post allo-HSCT is considered.

MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecules are a family of molecules normally found only on hematopoietic cells. cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system in humans and are important in disease defense.

They are the major cause of organ transplant rejections. Different HLA-DPB1 alleles exist in the general population. HLA-DPB1\*04:01 is the most frequent (70.5%) while HLA-DPB1\*02:01 represents 32% and HLA-DPB1\*03:01 20%. In allo-HSCT, the donor and the recipient may express different HLA-DPB1 molecules. HLA-DPB1 matching status has an impact on GVL (graft versus leukemia) and GVHD. In recipients of HSCT, a match for DPB1 is associated with a significantly increased risk of disease relapse, irrespective of the matching status of other HLA molecules.. Therefore, one could anticipate that a mismatched of HLA class II could induce a selective GVL reactivity without GVHD.

HLA-DP-expressing B cell and myeloid malignancies can be recognized and lysed by HLA-DP-specific T cells. The majority of leukemic cells (Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoid Leukemia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia) express HLA-DP. A T cell clone recognizing specifically HLA-DPB1\*0401 has been developed as a permanent cell line This clone has been demonstrated to be able to kill HLA-DPB1\*0401 positive leukemic cells. In addition, this clone harbors a special suicide gene allowing the destruction of the clone in presence of a specific anti-viral drug named ganciclovir.

We hypothesize that infusion of a third party suicide gene-transduced T cell clone directed against HLA-DPB1\*401 might protect against possible relapse of hematological malignancies.

We propose to inject iv escalating dose of a third party clone recognizing HLA-DPB1\*04:01, 4 to 5 months following transplantation (when immunosuppressive drugs have been discontinued) in patients HLA-DPB1\*04:01 positive with a donor HLA-DPB1\*04:01 negative to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, benefits of this immune intervention.",['ganciclovir'],['ganciclovir']

NCT04240496,"Clozapine (Clz), an atypical antipsychotic, is the reference medication for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Due to the high inter-individual variability of its pharmacokinetics and its narrow therapeutic index, a close therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Clz is highly recommended.

Several factors can cause a variation in the pharmacokinetics as age, smoking habits, coffee consumption and drug interaction. Genetic factors related to hepatic expression levels of the cytochrome P450 (CYP), regulate the hepatic clearance of Clz, thereby determine its bioavailability.

The CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes are mainly responsible for the metabolism of several drugs including Clz. It has been demonstrated that there is an interethnic variation in the expression and function of these two isoenzymes. This variation is caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding these proteins.

While the Influence of the different polymorphisms related to CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 have been established especially in Asian and Caucasian populations, no study has examined the impact of these SNPs in the southern Mediterranean populations. Moreover, the impact of these SNPs is very controversial. The present study aims to investigate in Tunisian schizophrenic patients, the influence of genetic (CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms) and non-genetic factors on Clz pharmacokinetics.","['Clozapine', 'Clz']","['clozapine', '']"
NCT02191124,"In recent years, measurement-based care (MBC) has been gaining more attention in the treatment of depression because it allows psychiatrists to individualize treatment decisions for each patient based on the change of psychopathology and tolerance toward antidepressants. Several studies, such as the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR\*D) trial using MBC, found that MBC-informed sequential algorithms can be successfully integrated into clinical practice and improve patients' outcomes However, despite a strong theoretical rationale for MBC and data supporting the ability to implement MBC in clinical practice settings, there is currently no randomized controlled trial in MDD patients comparing MBC with usual/standard care. The investigators compare MBC with clinician's treatment decisions, standardizing care to two commonly prescribed antidepressants.

NCT05216705,"This research focuses on alcohol withdrawal in hospitals and its potential neurological consequences.

Alcohol withdrawal is an event that induces physical symptoms, such as tremors, sweating, anxiety and requires medical support. Sometimes alcohol withdrawal results in neurological complications, such as epileptic seizures, delirium tremens, Wernicke Encephalopathy, memory and cognitive disorders. Chronic alcohol consumption and lack of vitamin B1 also cause neurological damage. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain can be used to assess severe forms, but gives little information about possible recovery and mild or transient forms.

Currently, there is no scientifically validated blood measurement to assess the intensity of these neurological complications, to predict their occurrence and recovery, or to distinguish between the consequences of chronic alcohol consumption, complications of alcohol withdrawal and vitamin B1 deficiency.

This is non-experimental, non-controlled observational research.

Four plasma biomarkers were selected to be evaluated in the field of alcoholology. t is the dosage of light neurofilaments (NFL), the Tau protein, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL-1). These biomarkers are studied, in particular in cerebrospinal fluid, in neurodegenerative diseases and in patients having experienced a cranial trauma. They were described in the literature as markers of cerebral suffering. NF-L would reflect the axon injury, Tau and UCHL-1 protein the neurons injury and GFAP the astrocytes injury. The Quanterix\* assay technique (SIMOA technology) allows simultaneous assay of these 4 biomarkers, with a detection threshold 100 times lower than that of the ELISA technique. This allows plasma assays to be performed and is therefore more accessible and less risky for the patient than assays in cerebrospinal fluid.

The objective was to study the kinetics of these four biomarkers (NFL, Tau, GFAP, UCHL-1) during alcohol withdrawal, it was decided to measure these plasma biomarkers at three points during alcohol withdrawal : at the beginning of withdrawal (T1 = J1), after the time when withdrawal is most intense and complications such as Wernicke Encephalopathy or delirium tremens usually occur (T2 = J3-J4), and at the end of alcohol withdrawal management (T3 = J13-J15).

The choice of performing T1 the day after the patient's admission (D1) and not the day of the patient's admission (D0) was determined to allow a better homogeneity of the plasma assay and to respect the reflection period before signing the consent. Indeed, patients may have different levels of alcohol in their blood when they are admitted on the morning of D0. This induces a heterogeneous clinic and interferes with the interview and the delivery of an informed information. Moreover, the dosage thus carried out at D1 will be done fasting, on waking, while the patient will be non-alcoholic, under identical conditions for all patients.

In this exploratory study, the number of subjects needed is set at 18 subjects who have completed the research, i.e., having had three samples at D1 (T1), D3-J4 (T2) and D13-J15 (T3) without alcohol consumption until T3. Subjects leaving the study before this third test will be replaced up to a maximum of 7 replacements. With no previous study to our knowledge measuring these biomarkers in alcohol withdrawal, we cannot anticipate the variance. We therefore set the number of subjects to be included based on the capacity of a SIMOA assay kit for the four biomarkers NLF, Tau, GFAP, and UCHL-1. Anticipating, the risk of alcohol reconsumption, early discharge and lost to follow-up, it is planned to include 25 patients. Inclusions will end after the third follow-up visit (T3) of the 18th patient for whom we will have all three samples taken (complete data) or after T3 of the 25th patient included.

The risks for the patient are the occurrence of a complication during the procedures included in the protocol, i.e. for all patients, one or more haematomas at the points of venous sampling or the occurrence of a vagal malaise.","['Vitamin B1', 'NFL (neurofilaments)', 'Tau protein', 'GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)', 'UCHL-1 (ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L1)']","['thiamine', '', '', '', '']"

NCT02019823,"General synopsis for SMS-text Adherence Support (\*StAR) Study and associated preparatory and pilot work

Background: High blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease. Clear evidence exists that for individuals with high blood pressure (hypertension) lowering blood pressure really reduces this risk. One of the critical factors in the long term control of blood pressure is the regular use of effective antihypertensive medications. In South Africa, poor treatment adherence (attending clinic, re-filling prescriptions, and regularly taking hypertension tablets) is known to be an important and alterable risk factor for uncontrolled high blood pressure and its complications (heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease). SMS-text messages have been shown to improve clinic attendance and medication adherence for some diseases (like HIV and TB) in other low-resource settings. It is not clear whether SMS-text messages to support treatment adherence have an effect on long-term blood pressure control. The acceptability, sustainability and scalability such technology also remains to be determined.

Aim: To investigate if a system of SMS-text messages to support treatment adherence is more effective than usual care for controlling high blood-pressure.

Objectives: The main objective is to test whether advice and support given by SMS-text, either by providing information (informational) or by allowing a two-way communication (interactive) improves control of blood pressure at one year compared to usual care.

Additional objectives include assessing whether the interventions have an effect on,

* Clinic attendance
* Prescription refill adherence
* Self-reported medication adherence
* Hypertension related illness or death
* Patient empowerment

Study design: Single centre randomized three-arm parallel group trial As it is not clear how best to support treatment adherence for people with hypertension we need to compare the different ways this might be done. Eligible patients who provide written consent will be put into one of three groups and then compared.

NCT05117450,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) results from the progressive and irreversible destruction of the kidneys. As of December 31, 2018, there were 89,692 people in France undergoing replacement therapy, including 49,271 (55%) on dialysis and 40,421 (45%) with a functioning kidney transplant. The primary treatment modality is currently hemodialysis. It is known to activate the coagulation cascade and blood platelets, leading to thrombus formation and premature termination of the hemodialysis session. This loss of circuitry results in a decrease in session time leading to an insufficient dialysis dose and blood loss in patients who are already often anemic due to their chronic renal failure.

To avoid this complication, current recommendations recommend the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) during the hemodialysis session at the cost of an obligatory hemorrhagic risk due to the systemic administration of heparin. However, this risk of bleeding is already very high, due to platelet dysfunction, a direct consequence of uremic toxin impregnation in these patients. In addition, this hemodialysis population is frequently exposed to antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants (heparin or VKA), which aggravate the hemorrhagic risk inherent to renal pathology.

In this context, bioactive membranes such as the HeprAN™ membrane, coated in heparin, have been developed to minimize or even eliminate the need for anticoagulation during sessions in chronic hemodialysis patients. Several studies with this membrane have demonstrated the absence of the need for additional heparin in populations with no particular bleeding risk and in populations at risk of bleeding: post-operative (HepZero study), patients on VKA.

The HYDROLINK™ membrane offers the same anticoagulant prospects as the HeprAN™ membrane, but its mode of action involves the use of a copolymer with hydrophilic properties, making it possible to avoid the presence of heparin. This membrane would have an influence on platelet aggregation. It would also make it possible to avoid the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) by completely excluding heparin from the dialysis session","['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'unfractionated heparin', 'low molecular weight heparin', 'VKA', 'HYDROLINK™ membrane', 'HeprAN™ membrane']","['ibuprofen', 'paracetamol', '', '', '', '', '']"

NCT04625036,"The 2019 coronavirus-induced infection (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic that has spread worldwide. Up to date, many subjects affected by the virus report important sequelae on different organs increasing morbidity and exacerbating previous pathological conditions. Mortality is also increased in cases of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes. COVID-19 infection is caused by Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Concerning the specific interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, we know that this virus enters the body through the receptors for the conversion of angiotensin II (ACE2r) that are present in the lungs, heart, intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium. This receptor's availability suggests a multi-organ involvement with a consequent multi-organ dysfunction, as found in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Furthermore, poor vascular peripheral function -usually correlated with old age and long periods of bed rest or hypomobility- is a distinguishing characteristic of the population affected by COVID-19, as well. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that peripheral vascular function, already deteriorated by aging and common age-related diseases, can be further compromised by COVID-19 and by the forced hypomobility, typically experienced during the acute phase of the disease.

NCT03080766,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with distinct clinicopathologic features sharing in common an abnormal increase in myeloblasts in blood and bone marrow (BM). In about 5-10% patients, the myeloblasts exhibit chromosomal abnormalities (complex and/or monosomal karyotype, CK/MK\*) that are associated with refractoriness to conventional chemotherapy and an extremely bad prognosis.

Standard induction chemotherapy for AML comprises daunorubicin and cytarabine, the ""7+3"" regimen. However, treatment is largely ineffective for CK/MK AML with a temporary clearance of blasts achieved in only 30-40% cases and the cumulative toxicities resulting from repeated courses of chemotherapy have significantly increased the morbidity and mortality risks in subsequent allogeneic BMT. Therefore, standard treatment is unsatisfactory and there is an unmet clinical need for more effective and less toxic induction regimen.

Both previous and recent studies showed that 10 day course of decitabine (20 mg/m2/day) induced remission in 70-100% patients with CK/MK AML, particularly those with TP53 mutations. In this study, patients with CK/MK AML will be treated with decitabine to induce remission.

NCT02584985,"Standard surgical treatment of mid and low rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME). Originally performed by open surgery, TME demonstrated improved local control and reduced urogenital morbidity. Laparoscopic approach has been validated by several randomised controlled trials: laparoscopic approach offers to the patient a better post-operative recovery, a lower risk of wound hernia and comparable oncological results. However, the risk of conversion to open procedure remains significant.

Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy allows retrograd mesorectal excision, performing the whole pelvic dissection via a specific-moderate cost device. The procedure is then completed by a briefer transabdominal laparoscopic step to mobilise the colon and perform inferior mesenteric vessels ligation, prior to low coloanal anastomosis. The originality of this approach is to perform a surgical dissection via an extra peritoneal route, without peritoneal and abdominal wound trauma. This focuses on new technical improvement in the area of mini-invasive pelviabdominal surgery using natural orifice as surgical access. This approach offer closer and better exposure of pelvic dissection plane and could improve oncological quality and pelvic nerve preservation. It could be profitable to postoperative patient outcome. However rates and type of cancer-recurrences as well as functional results have to be assessed in a controlled study. This technique has shown to be feasible and reproducible through early clinical series. Conversion rates appear to be lower than published rates of laparoscopic approach, markedly inferior to 10%. Compiled rates of morbidity (27.8%), R1 resection\* (6%), mesorectum macroscopic integrity (100%) appear to be comparable to laparoscopic approach results. However functional results as well as urologic morbidity have to be evaluated in comparative studies. In a preliminary retrospective comparative (n=72) we founded comparable oncological quality criteria (R1 resection 5.9% vs 10.5% p 0.74, Grade 3 mesorectal integrity 57.5 vs 56.2 p 0.99), lower conversion rate to open procedure (2.9% vs 23.6% p 0.011), shorter in-hospital stay (8 vs 9 days p 0.038). Comparable morbidity rates (Dindo 1-4 27% vs 34% p 0.52) and functional results (Kirwan 1/2 80.3% vs 80.6% p 0.94) were also founded. These data need to be confirmed. To this date, Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy has been evaluated through preliminary studies including several short series demonstrating the feasibility of the technique and showing low morbidity. For some authors the benefit of transanal approach is significant in difficult cases such as male patient and narrow pelvis. Very recently, two non randomised comparative studies were published with conclusions close to those in our study.

Investigators propose, with the support of the GRECCAR group, to conduct a national, multicenter, open-label randomized study based on oncological non-inferiority (R1 resection rate) for the main objective, comparing Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy to Standard Transabdominal Laparoscopic Proctectomy, for low lying rectal cancer requiring manual colo-anal anastomosis. There is a clear expected benefit expected for the patients through the ETAP procedure in term of post operative short term outcome, risk of conversion to open procedure, risk of wound hernia.This trial could also show significant advantages in terms of quality of dissection, quality of the specimen, quality of nerve preservation.","['placebo', 'Laparoscopic', 'Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy']","['', '', '']"

NCT05761522,"Previous studies of our team reported the improvement of myocardial contractility both on hemodynamic parameters (by transpulmonary thermodilution) and morphological (by transthoracic echocardiography: TTE), during the early phase of septic shock (during the first 4 hours management of septic shock).

However, one can wonder about the effect of NAD on myocardial cardiac ouput and contractility beyond the early phase of septic shock, more precisely beyond the first 24 hours. Indeed, while it continues to act on the ""stressed"" blood volume and the diastolic left ventricular perfusion by increasing the diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), it has been reported in old studies that beyond the early phase, the sensitivity of the β1-adrenergic receptors is altered due to the phenomenon of internalization of these receptors, leading to a reduction of the myocardial response to catecholamines.

The investigators can then wonder whether norepinephrine still exerts a positive effect on myocardial contractility via the increase in DAP, despite an alteration of the β1-adrenergic pathway.

To answer this question, the investigators proposed to evaluate the effects of norepinephrine by TTE on cardiac contractility after the initial phase.","['NAD', 'norepinephrine']","['nadide', 'norepinephrine']"

NCT05946109,"Despite the high level of evidence for physical activity as a countermeasure for frailty, the current Flemish standard of care does not include structural PA interventions for community-dwelling frail older adults. One barrier for this, is the high cost of supervised physical activity programmes.

Therefore, in this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, the investigators will consider the Flemish current standard of care for frail older adults as a control group. Intervention condition 1 reflects the state-of-the-art physical activity intervention provided by professionals and intervention condition 2 consists of the same intervention provided by trained volunteers. It is hypothesized that the intervention in both intervention conditions will have significant effects on functional ability, cognition, loneliness, self-management, subjective health and meaningful activities and that it can alleviate the financial burden of condition 1 (cost-effectiveness). The pretrajectory of this study was based on the 'British Medical Research Council guidance' for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. This resulted in a comprehensive, state-of-the art personalised physical activity programme for community-dwelling frail older adults: ACTIVE-AGE@home. The programme adheres to current guidelines for physical activity and exercise for frail older adults and considers low threshold and meaningful activities for the participants.

NCT05516784,"Several studies have shown that pharmacodynamic (PD) response varies between patients treated with clopidogrel and that individuals with reduced response have an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events, particularly in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. This is due to several factors influencing the response to clopidogrel, including genetic variations of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. Loss of function (LOF) carriers of the CYP2C19 gene are associated with the decreased generation of the active metabolite clopidogrel and decreased platelet inhibition, which translates to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Thus, drug regulatory authorities have cautioned about the decreased efficacy of clopidogrel among individuals with CYP2C19 LOF carriers and suggested using alternative therapies to inhibit p2Y12. Ticagrelor is a new generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with greater efficacy for PD and reduced rates of ischemic events compared with clopidogrel and are not affected by the CYP2C19 LOF polymorphism. However, in clinical practice, the genotype-guided selection strategy for the oral P2Y12 inhibitor has been limited despite intensive research efforts. This is due to the interaction of cardiovascular risk factors and molecular and biochemical complications that lead to poor response to platelet inhibitor therapy, which impedes physicians' ability to prescribe a more effective and personalized antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, we must move away from traditional approaches and use integrated systems biology study designs and disciplines to bridge the gap between genotype, phenotype, disease manifestation and/or recurrence. Pharmacometabolomics is a rapidly developing field that takes advantage of a systems pharmacology approach to probe the molecular pathways involved in drug response variability to understand metabolic changes and identify novel biomarkers that can be used to predict response more comprehensively. Using profiles of changes in metabolites can help establish drug exposure fingerprints and clarify the determinants of drug response.

NCT02453542,"Background

The treatment of haemophilia A and B has been revolutionized by the use of factor concentrate, both as prophylaxis and to treat bleeding episodes (on-demand treatment). However, despite its advantages, repeated treatment with factor concentrate can lead to development of inhibitors (antibodies) towards the coagulation factor in the concentrate. Another patient group in which the bleeding symptoms are difficult to treat because of inhibitors towards coagulation factors, most commonly FVIII, is patients with acquired haemophilia. Patients with high antibody titers exhibit a deficient or no response to factor concentrates and usually need treatment with bypassing agents, namely factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent (FEIBA®, Baxter) och recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, Novo-Seven®, Novo Nordisk). The effect of the treatment cannot be accurately monitored by traditional coagulation tests.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the utility of the global haemostatic methods in patients with haemophilia with inhibitors. The objective is to improve the monitoring of the treatment effect and thus increase the safety of the patient and the effectiveness of the treatment.

Patients and methods

Patients

The primary cohort will consist of fifteen patients with inherited haemophilia with inhibitors as well as five adult patients with acquired haemophilia who are followed up at the Coagulation Department of the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Blood samples will be collected from those patients at specific time points (see Design of the study) during the course of two years (for each patient). The treatment (type, dose, duration) will be determined by the treating physician.

Methods (selection)

* Thrombin generation (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram, CAT® and a commercial kit from Siemens®).
* Overall haemostatic potential (OHP)

Design of the study

Timeframe for blood sampling: i) baseline (inclusion in the study), and ii) prior and after administration of bypassing agents to either treat bleeding symptoms or before an invasive procedure or as prophylaxis.

Data analysis

NCT02829853,"Major impacts of air pollution are lung diseases such as granulomatous diseases and mainly sarcoidosis. Understanding the respective role of inorganic / nanoparticles and genetic background in these chronic diseases is a major challenge for the management of patients and prevention strategies. Granulomas are characterized by giant epithelioid and multinucleated cells, reflecting a severe disturbance in immunological pathways induced both by toxic exposure and genetic predisposition. Previous studies demonstrated that professional environmental context and acute exposures (the World Trade Center disaster) to micro/nanoparticles have a pathogenic impact with a sharp increase in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multifactorial disease occurring in a genetically vulnerable context. Many gene variants have been linked to an increased odds-ratio of the disease, such BTNL2, CCDC88B, ANNEXIN A11 involved in regulation of T-cell activation and maturation pathways. We have contributed since 2008 to a national cohort (GSF, 28 centers) of ≈ 800 sarcoidosis patients with familial and sporadic presentation of the disease. This collection has been an exceptional (and worldwide unique) tool for the implementation of an exhaustive clinical database on sarcoidosis, modelling of disease evolution and identification of clinical / genetic criteria differentiating sporadic and familial forms.

The main goals of the project are:

1. Completion of the genetic data in order to establish a pattern of gene variants segregating with familial forms of the disease, compared to sporadic one. This will be done by WES (WHOLE EXOME) analysis on the previously collected DNA samples. The informed consent for the patients included the information about the BTNL2 gene, which has been already tested since 2008, and related genes connected to immune pathways, thus allowing a unambiguous information about the research finality of the project.
2. Completion of the clinical data about each patient, in cooperation with the GSF network, management of the database established since 2008. The data collected are those which are commonly detailed in the normal follow-up of the patients. The project do not include any new interventions on the patient (neither radiological or invasive tests).
3. Specific biological studies might be done on the white blood cells of the patients, and might need in such cases a new blood sampling, both in patients and first degree related healthy controls.

NCT03053349,"Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) appears to be an effective strategy to expand the lung donor pool by better evaluation and reconditioning of non standard grafts. Today, EVLP is clinical practice at the most active transplant centers in North America and Europe.

The aim of this observational prospective monocentric study is to prove the safety and efficacy of EVLP performed in the setting of Bergamo lung transplant program.

A statistically estimated sample size would not fit with the small numbers of Italian lung transplant activity, so the investigators decided to enrol 10 consecutive recipients of grafts subjected to EVLP.

Non standard grafts from Brain Dead Donors (BDD) and Donors after Cardiac Death (DCD) and standard grafts that will undergo prolonged cold ischemic time will be selected for EVLP.

The donor lung procurement operation will be done in the usual manner. The EVLP procedure will be performed in the operating theater of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital. The investigators decided to adopt Toronto protocol since it involves some lung protective strategies. EVLP will proceed over a period of at least 4 and not more than 6 hours.

* ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PO2/FiO2, mmHg)
* Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR, dine\*s/cm5)
* Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP, cmH2O) and mean airways Pressure (Pawm, cmH2O)
* dynamic lung Compliance (Cpldyn, ml/ cmH2O)
* ΔPO2 = pulmonary vein PO2 - pulmonary artery PO2 (mmHg). Moreover, after 60 and 240 minutes from the start of EVLP a graft X-ray and a bronchoscopy will be performed.

The lung graft will be accepted for transplantation if, after 240 minutes from the start of EVLP, the following conditions are fulfilled:

* PO2/FiO2 \>350 mmHg
* stability or reduction of PVR compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment time point
* stability or reduction of PIP and Pawm compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment time point
* stable or better Cpldyn compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment time point

NCT03288441,"Background: Antithrombotic therapy in the context of treatment related thrombocytopenia (i.e. low levels of platelets) is not uncommon. Guidelines are based upon a paucity of retrospective data and focus on the scenario of cancer associated venous thrombosis and low molecular weight heparin treatment. Even less is known regarding direct oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulation prescribed for other indications.

Aims: The study aims are to evaluate how physicians manage anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication in patients with hematological malignancy and thrombocytopenia, and to assess the frequency of bleeding and thrombosis. Additional aims are to assess how management changes affect drug activity and blood clotting (coagulation), and to evaluate the use of platelet transfusions.

Design: The investigators plan a multinational prospective registry of patients admitted to the inpatient hematology department or outpatient clinic at one of the study centers. Patients with hematological malignancies, platelets below 50 X 109/L, and anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medication will be studied.

Patients will be enrolled when the combination of antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication and thrombocytopenia is first detected. Patients will be followed until 30 days after the baseline study visit (which occurs 30 days after enrollment or when platelets \< 50\*109/L, whichever come first) or death. Patients will be indexed at the time of baseline visit.

Patients will be excluded from study analysis if one of the following events occurs before study index: Withdrawal of consent, death, clinically-relevant non-major bleeding or the composite primary outcome.

Risk factors for bleeding and thrombosis will be recorded at baseline. Parameters from routine blood tests will be recorded throughout the study. During the study major bleeding events and thrombosis will be recorded. Investigational blood tests assessing coagulation and drug activity will be drawn at baseline (=study index). Throughout the study all management decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy, including platelet and red blood cell transfusion, will be recorded. This is an observational study and management will be solely at the discretion of the physician.

NCT04889807,"Hypovolemia is one of major factor of haemodynamic instability. Fluid administration is not totally riskless. Indeed, it can create or inflate pulmonary oedema, alter gaz exchanges and increase post operative respiratory complications. Furthermore, fluid administration is not always followed by a cardiac output increase.

Predicting preload responsiveness before administering fluid by reliable and reproductible methods is necessary in critically ill patients.

Dynamic indicators are approved at the bedside such as passive raising leg test, pulse pressure variation, respiratory variation of the diameter of the superior vena cava.

NCT01749293,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for patients with many hematologic malignancies (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma with high risk of relapse). This process requires a suitable donor. The best case scenario involves an Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor. However, this type of donor is not always available. Donor registries can provide another source for matched unrelated donors, but this may take valuable time delaying treatment for the transplant recipient. Donor availability remains a significant barrier to the use of allogeneic (from a donor) stem cell transplant. This issue disproportionately affects patients of minority backgrounds. Novel strategies to improve outcomes using alternative donors are desperately needed.

Haploidentical transplants are an alternative which provides a readily available donor in the form of a partially HLA matched family member. This provides for more potential donors and the donors can be selected based on other factors that can play a role in transplant success (e.g. age, gender, KIR alloreactivity). Recent advances in transplant techniques have greatly improved success rates with haploidentical transplants although disease relapse has remained as issue.

This trial aims to provide an alternative transplant option for patients with hematologic malignancies who require bone marrow transplantation but lack an HLA identical donor.

NCT03199885,"This randomized phase III trial studies how well paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with or without atezolizumab works in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab is a form of ""targeted therapy"" because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pertuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with or without atezolizumab may kill more tumor cells.

Depending on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P\<0.001).Thus, it is the major aim to develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities.

A number of commercial digital software is being offered to supply the medical practioner with tools to assess normal and pathological bony architecture land marks.

The relevant architecture of the pelvis (hip joint), spine and the length and alignment of lower limbs may be measured using these digital software's.

The validity and accuracy of digital work in comparison to conventional radiographs has been studied recently, mainly with lower extremity axial alignment, the digital length and anatomical angles measurements were found to be more reliable in terms of intra observer reliability than conventional radiographs (1, 2).

Study purposes

1. To compare the, accuracy and reliability of specifically designed digital software (TraumaCad from OrthoCrat ™) measurements using wizard guidance, to those produced by using the tool bar (ruler and angle guide tools) of the DICOM folder.
2. To assess intra and inter observer reliability of the TraumaCad software for different pediatric orthopaedics conditions.

   Methods \*Twenty hip joins radiographs (AP views) of patients who suffer from Cerebral Palsy (10) and Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (10) will be measured using the TraumaCad software hip joint wizard, and than again using basic tools of the DICOM folder.

   \*\*Twenty spinal scoliosis radiographs (AP and Lat views) will be measured using the TraumaCad software templates.

   \*\*\*Ten digital radiographs of long leg standing (AP views) from normal and from patients with deformities will ne analyzed for length and angular differences using the LLD wizard.

   The following parameters will be measured \*Hip joint radiographs: Acetabular Angle, Central Edge Angle, and Reimer's Index \*\*Spinal radiographs: Cobe Angle (AP views), Coronal Balance, Sagital Balance. \*\*\*Long standing views: length of Femur and Tibia, mLDFA, mMPTA, mLDTA, JLCA, (the ""Baltimore numbers"").

   All measurements will be taken by 4 senior orthopaedic surgeons after consensus conference for the technique.

   Intra observer reliability will be tested by repeating the same set of measurements on 2 different dates, after all radiographs are randomly mixed and done at least 2 days apart. High resolution single computer will be used for all measurements by all participating surgeons.

   The intra and inter observer reliability for the hip joint measurements will be calculate to compared between TraumaCad software wizard and the DICOM measurements tools.

   All measurements using TraumaCad software will be analyzed for intra and inter observer reliability using accepted statistical tools.

NCT04864249,"The investigators are conducting a single center, randomized controlled trial testing the impact of a neonatal sleep intervention, the SNOO, on reducing maternal blood pressure (BP) in the postpartum period in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The SNOO is a responsive bassinet designed to automatically calm and consolidate infants by responding to their cries. Use of the SNOO has been demonstrated to improve infant sleep by 1-2 hours nightly, thus increasing maternal sleep time. The investigators plan for 110 women with pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia to be randomized 1:1 to either receive and use the SNOO responsive bassinet for their infants, or to receive the usual care of safe sleep education. Women will be followed longitudinally through 6 months postpartum with serial BPs, weights, mood assessments, and subjective and objective sleep assessments. The investigators hypothesize that for women with pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, that poor maternal sleep quality contributes to increased BP in the postpartum period.

Resuscitated STEMI-patients receiving targeted temperature management (TTM, therapeutic hypothermia) after cardiac arrest, however, show deteriorated and delayed early response to available oral P2Y12r inhibitors. Therapeutic hypothermia attenuates the drugs' effectiveness by reducing its gastrointestinal absorption and metabolic activation. Acute stent thrombosis is 5-fold increased after angioplasty following resuscitated cardiac arrest because of insufficient early platelet suppression. Thus, aggressive antiplatelet strategies are needed to achieve optimal platelet suppression during PCI in those patients. The first intravenous P2Y12r inhibitor, cangrelor, has recently received marketing authorization for the acute treatment of STEMI.

NCT05353699,"Background: The disease burden of hypertension(HTN) and type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM) is rising rapidly in China.Comprehensive interventions(Implementation strategies for providers and interventions for patients) are critical to strengthen primary health care systems and address the burden of multiple comorbidities. In order to promote equal access to health services and narrow the gap in population health, China has launched the national Essential Public Health Services Equity Programme (EPHSEP) nationwide. EPHSEP contains guidelines for health management services for HTN and type 2 DM. The program has been in operation for 10 years. However, the management of HTN and type 2 DM in China is far from satisfactory. The purpose of this study is to understand current control and management situation of HTN and type 2 DM, investigate the barriers and facilitators in the implementation of HTN and type 2 DM service delivery standards, propose feasible implementation strategies,implement in certain areas,and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and the performance and impact of implementation strategies.

Methods: Based on previous work,four community health service centres and four township health centres will be selected in West Coast District of Qingdao city of Shandong province,Suzhou City of Jiangsu province, Changsha city of Hunan province and Luohe city of Henan Province.In each of the four provinces,one community health service center and one township health center will be selected.Two community health service centres and two township health centres will be selected as the intervention groups, and the other community health service centres and township health centres will be selected as the control groups.

The study will be divided into three phases: Phase 1, 2 and 3. Phase 1 and phase 2 cross-sectional studies are the basis for phase 3 intervention studies.

Phase 1 will be conducted from March 2022 to April 2022.In phase 1, a quantitative questionnaire survey will be conducted among 5464 HTN and 7040 type 2 DM patients in 8 community health service centers to obtain the data of awareness rate, screening rate, diagnosis rate, treatment rate, control rate and management service of hypertension and type 2 diabetes patients,so as to understand current control and management situation of HTN and type 2 DM.

Phase 2 will be conducted in April 2022. In phase 2, about 64 medical staff and related managers providing HTN and type 2 DM health management services and 80 patients with HTN and type 2 DM in 8 community health service centers will be investigated through qualitative interviews,so as to investigate the barriers and facilitators in the implementation of HTN and type 2 DM service delivery standards and to propose feasible implementation strategies.

Phase 3 will be conducted a mixed-methods type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study from May 2022 to January 2023. Interventions are divided into four levels through a cascading model of screening, diagnosis, treatment, and control. Implementation strategies are divided into 6 categories according to Implementation Mapping: Capacity-building strategies（Recruit, designate, and train for leadership; Work with educational institutions), Supervision(Provide clinical supervision), Integration strategies(Remind clinicians; Use data warehousing techniques), Implementation process Strategies(Identify and prepare champions; Identify early adopters; Inform local opinion leaders; Involve patients/consumers and family members; Obtain and use patients/consumers and family feedback), Dissemination strategies(Make training dynamic), Scale-up strategies(Use train-the-trainer strategies;Place innovation on fee for service lists/formularies).

NCT02153905,"Background:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patients white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3 incorporated in the retrovirus.

Objective:

The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE A3 cells) cause tumors to shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe

Eligibility:

- Adults age 18-66 with cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule.

Design:

* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed
* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti MAGE-A3 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}
* Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti MAGE-A3 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.",['aldesleukin'],['aldesleukin']

The investigators propose to conduct a single center randomized controlled trial in which 150 patients will be assigned to either a mindfulness meditation condition, a disease education control condition, or a stress-monitoring usual care control condition. They will test the following specific hypotheses:

1. In comparison to either of the control conditions, significantly more coronary artery disease (CAD) patients in the mindfulness meditation condition will demonstrate reductions in mental stress-induced ischemia.
2. The ratio of low-to-high frequency of spectral power in heart rate variability during ambulatory monitoring will be significantly decreased following the participation in a stress reduction program compared with those in a disease education or usual care condition.
3. Patients in the mindfulness meditation condition will report greater improvement in quality of life (i.e., reductions in general psychological symptomology, anger, anxiety, depression, and daily stress, along with increases in optimism and stress coping efficacy) than patients in either of the control conditions.
4. Day-to-day variability in self-reported mental stress will be inversely related to day-to-day stress coping efficacy in the entire sample and time spent in mindfulness practice in the active treatment condition, and these relationships will be maintained over a 3-month follow-up.
5. Patients with CAD and mental stress ischemia who show an \*abnormal peripheral artery response during baseline studies will show a significant improvement after mindfulness intervention.

NCT02138617,"This study involves standard combination chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer, 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), leucovorin and irinotecan (known as FOLFIRI), plus bevacizumab (Avastin). The study is designed to test the FOLFIRI regimen based on certain characteristics of a person's genetic makeup or ""genes"". Genes are made of DNA and determine not only inherited traits or appearance (hair and eye color, height, body type, etc.) but also play an important role in health and how the body responds to illness and treatments for those illnesses.

In this study, the investigators will examine the relationship between a patient's genes (DNA), or ""genotype"", and how the patient's body breaks down and removes or ""metabolizes"" the anti-cancer drug irinotecan. Circulating blood level of irinotecan plays an important role in how well this drug works against a patient's cancer as well as the adverse side effects the patient may experience. The current standard dose of irinotecan was determined in clinical trials without knowing individual genotypes and thus does not take into account a patient's ability to metabolize irinotecan. This means that based on one genotype the current standard dose of irinotecan may be correct or based on other genotypes the standard dose could result in lower and possibly less effective blood levels and result in significant under-dosing of irinotecan.

Based on genotype the patient will be assigned to one of the following doses of irinotecan:

* 180 mg/m2 (standard dose)
* 260 mg/m2
* 310 mg/m2

The purpose of this research study is to determine if dosing irinotecan based on genotype is effective and safe for patients with colon cancer. Patient genotype will be determined from a small sample of blood and a laboratory test or ""assay"" performed at UNC Laboratories. For the purpose of this study, this assay is new and considered to be ""investigational"".

NCT02527330,"Heart failure from myocardial iron deposition is a severe complication for patients with hematological disorders who need repeated blood transfusions. Increased cardiac iron content impacts the contractility of cardiomyocytes and can also lead to myocarditis, pericarditis, and arrhythmias. The severity of cardiac dysfunction depends on the amount of iron deposited in the myocardium.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is used as noninvasive method to evaluate the amount of iron in the heart. Myocardial T2\* value has been shown to correlate well with biopsy-derived iron concentration in the heart, and myocardial T2\* values less than 20ms (indicating elevated iron) were found to be associated with LV dysfunction and improve in concert with LV function during recovery. The majority of the recent studies about myocardial iron overload and the effect of iron chelation therapy were focused on patients with transfusion-dependent hematological disorder, especially beta-thalassemia major.

The objective of this 3-year project is to evaluate myocardial iron deposition in patients with heart failure, induced by variable causes. With myocardial T2\* imaging, the investigators will analyze the decreased signal intensity in the ventricular septum and quantitatively acquire the T2\* value as marker for myocardial iron deposition. The first year is a cross-sectional study. The investigators aim to compare the severity of myocardial iron deposition of normal subjects and that of stable HF patients in recovery with normal or impaired ejection fraction (EF). Total 60 subjects will be enrolled, with 20 subjects in each group. In the 2nd and 3rd years, the investigators plan a prospective longitudinal study of 40 subjects. Enrolled patients will be evaluated with cardiac T2\* imaging at three time points, i.e., disease onset, 6 months and one year after treatment, and will be followed up until the end of this project (1.5\~3-year follow up). In total 120 MR scans will be performed in the 2nd and 3rd years.

NCT03590509,"Children with medical complexity (CMC) account for \<1% of all children but approximately 40% of all pediatric deaths and inpatient care spending in the U.S.1 Optimizing their outcomes requires a comprehensive approach to augmenting care in all settings: clinic, hospital, and home.

NCT01215721,"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men and is the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer in men. Radical prostatectomy is one of the treatment options available for organ-confined disease. Over 100,000 radical prostatectomies cases (total removal of the cancerous prostate by surgery) are performed in the United States yearly. Unfortunately nearly all of the men undergoing surgery report diminished Quality of Life (QOL) scores due in part due to a postoperative incontinence which may require the use of multiple urinary pads per day. Many of these men also report debilitating irritative voiding symptoms of urinary urgency and frequency, and have overall decreased urinary satisfaction scores. Abatement of these symptoms can take up to one year in men, and in 5-20% of patients symptoms may persist for longer periods.

Our recent published findings suggest that instability in the bladder muscle is likely an underlying etiology in postoperative urinary incontinence. This 'Detrusor Muscle' instability results in excess contractions of the urinary bladder ('urgency to urinate'), and can result in the feeling of needing to urinate more frequently. Consistent with this hypothesis of detrusor muscle instability, men with postoperative dribbling had more complaints with urgency, frequency and bother scores when queried with validated questionnaires. We suspect that a transient bladder muscle contraction may overcome the urinary sphincter valve resistance and result in the patient's dribbling of urine.

By treating the bladder muscle instability, we expect improved postoperative continence and improved quality of life in patients after undergoing surgery for total removal of a cancerous prostate. This pilot study will assess the statistical requirements for the number of subjects needed for a fully 'powered' randomized prospective study to fully evaluate whether medications such as solifenacin significantly improve patients' quality of urinary life and improve postoperative urinary incontinence after surgery.

NCT01989000,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease. Patients with resectable or borderline resectable disease may benefit from preoperative radiochemotherapy. However, only a subset of patients will respond to this potentially toxic and expensive treatment. Therefore, novel predictive markers are needed to determine treatment efficacy at an early stage. Preferably, these markers could be determined non-invasively and provide insight into the biology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancers are heterogeneous tumors. The tumor microenvironment is often characterized by large amounts of stroma, hypovascularization, and hypoxia. As these three factors can all contribute to treatment resistance, a quantitative assessment of these markers may aid in the prediction of response to preoperative radiochemotherapy. Moreover, these assessments may have prognostic value. Finally, further insight into the interrelation of these aspects of the tumor microenvironment can contribute to the evaluation of new targeted treatment options. Tumor cellularity and extracellular matrix composition can be assessed non-invasively in vivo by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and tumor vascularity can be assessed by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Finally, tumor hypoxia can be evaluated by T2\* MRI and PET-CT, using the 18F-labeled hypoxic marker HX4.

NCT00526188,"Participants who had been diagnosed or suspected by doctors to have focal liver lesions that need further evaluation in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Participants would need to have an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan so that doctors could have further information about the number and characteristics of the focal liver lesions.

Participants were invited to take part in this clinical study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Primovist, which is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium, on the efficacy of lesion detection and characterization, and tolerability in Chinese patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions.

Primovist, the investigational drug in this study, is a liver-specific MRI contrast medium developed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Its active substance is Gd-EOB-DTPA. Primovist was first approved in 2004 in Sweden followed by an approval in the European community, in Switzerland and Australia in the same year.

Procedures:

Before entry into the study and after entry of the study a physical examination was conducted, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, blood and urine samples were taken. Current medications and medical conditions (including suspected pregnancy) and medical and surgical history were elicited by doctors.

After entry into the study, participants were scheduled to have an MRI examination, which lasted about 25-35 minutes.

During the MRI examination, an initial MRI scan without contrast was acquired which followed by another MRI series after the intravenous administration of Primovist.

The following day participants were asked to return to the hospital for a follow-up safety evaluation.

Possible Benefit Participants were scheduled to receive an enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan. Clinical studies indicated that Primovist increased the efficacy of detection and characterization of focal liver lesions by providing better contrast between the focal liver lesions and surrounding normal tissue. Primovist were shown to provide additional information regarding existence, number and characterization (lesion or non-lesion, malignant or benign) of these abnormalities.

Based on the experience with patients given Primovist, some adverse reactions were observed.

Most of undesirable effects were transient and of mild to moderate intensity. The most commonly noted adverse events (AEs) in subjects receiving Primovist for MRI were nausea and headache with an incidence of 1.1%. Other AEs that occurred in 0.5% of the subject population were feeling hot (0.8%), back pain (0.6%) and dizziness (0.5%).

All other AEs occurred in less than 0.5% of the patients, e.g. anxiety; coughing; eye disorder; fever; flatulence; generalized spasm; hypertension; injection site symptoms including edema, inflammation, and reaction; lightheadedness; parosmia; postural hypotension; taste perversion, motoric unrest; acute respiratory distress; fatigue; malaise; vomiting; palpitations, erythema, chest pain and back pain.

Coldness, warmth or pain at the injection site, injection site reaction, and injection site accumulation of fluid were rare. In very rare cases strong allergy-like reactions ranging to shock may occur.

Post-marketing tachycardia and restlessness have been reported. As in the case of other investigational drugs, there may also be unforeseen side effects.

Additional information concerning all Gadolinium- based contrast agents Primovist contains the rare earth metal gadolinium as active ingredient. There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents (especially Omniscan) in patients with severe renal impairment. NSF is a systemic disease characterised by formation of connective tissue in the skin, which becomes thickened and hard, sometimes leading to contractures and joint immobility. The clinical course is usually progressive and currently no treatment is available. To date NSF has only been reported in association with some Gd-containing contrast agents, but the role of these contrast agents in the overall pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely understood.

No reports of patients with NSF after administration of Primovist® are known. The risk to trigger NSF in risk patients with severe renal impairment is considered to be low for Primovist® due to the low dose given and the additional excretion via feces. Furthermore the participation of patients with severe renal impairment are excluded from this study.

In case the participants were suffering from renal insufficiency, they were told to tell their doctors prior to application of the contrast agent. In case the participants experienced any new alterations of the skin following the administration of the contrast agent, they were told to contact their doctors as soon as possible after they had recognized these symptoms.","['Primovist', 'Gd-EOB-DTPA', 'Omniscan']","['gadoxetic acid', 'gadoxetic acid', 'gadodiamide']"

NCT05734768,"In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) counted no less than 15 million preterm births each year worldwide, or more than one in ten children. In recent years, the number of newborns surviving preterm birth has gradually increased due to advances in neonatal medicine. However, these rescues are not without consequences.

Indeed, to do so, the child is separated from his parents, placed in a stressful, technical and potentially painful environment. This early separation is compounded by medical co-morbidities and sedations that compromise the child's physiology and availability to interact. Extreme prematurity also disrupts the early interactions between the child and his parents, and eventually the relationships with others. Thus, more than 35% of children born prematurely show insecure attachment behavior in their relationships with others.

Moreover, premature births are accompanied by numerous somatic, cognitive and social cognitive difficulties. At school age, these children present more learning, social-emotional and behavioral problems. The greater the degree of prematurity, the more marked these difficulties are. They would be associated with an executive and social cognition deficit, inherent to a globally altered cerebral development, in particular the frontal subcortical cerebral regions.

On the parents' side, premature birth is also fraught with consequences. Indeed, the idea of an idealized post-natal period gives way to an anxious, even traumatic experience. Notions of guilt are often expressed, as well as major anxiety about the child's survival and ""parenting skills"". A higher prevalence of signs of parental anxiety, postnatal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder is observed in mothers of premature infants, even up to 18 months after birth. These psychological states influence the parents' ability to interact with their newborn, as well as the content of these interactions.

Finally, both parents and newborns see, for different reasons, their ability to interact and to reassure themselves profoundly disrupted by premature birth.

Even if since 2010, prematurity has been identified as a ""public health problem"" by the WHO, studies on the subject still have limitations. Indeed, if we estimate that the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression signs in mothers of premature babies is on average three times higher than in mothers of full-term babies; what about fathers? It seems fundamental to improve our knowledge of the anxious and depressive symptoms that fathers and mothers of premature babies may display, with the aim of providing comprehensive and multidisciplinary care for families in neonatal intensive care units.

Similarly, the exact impact of an increase in parental anxious depressive symptomatology on the precursors of cognitive and social cognitive development is not known. Since the environment and stimulation are fundamental to the child's development, what happens when one or both parents have their interaction modified by anxious-depressive symptomatology? Indeed, the rare studies publishing data on the subject are carried out on populations of parents of non-premature children, often non-French-speaking and above all with tools that are not available to French-speaking practitioners in charge of the early detection of developmental difficulties in premature children. Today, it seems necessary to provide data concerning the development of precursors to cognitive and social cognitive development in preterm infants, and to better understand the extent of its interaction with the anxious depressive symptomatology of the mother and father.

The investigators therefore formulate the following hypotheses:

* Anxious depressive symptomatology, such as signs of parental anxiety, postnatal depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder, would be higher in mothers and fathers of preterm infants than in mothers and fathers of full-term infants at 7 ± 1 weeks after birth.
* The level of development of the precursors to cognitive and social cognitive development would be lower in children whose parents present an exacerbated anxious depressive symptomatology.",[],[]

Higher doses of acetaminophen may also have the ability to prevent the platelets from clotting, however only temporarily.

NCT04884412,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) has evolved over the past decades as a mainstream therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The classical procedure consists in STN indirect targeting based on stereotactic atlases or statistical coordinates in AC-PC (Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure) referential along with target control and correction by micro-electrode recordings (MER) and awake clinical testing. To avoid potential complications and patient discomfort related to current procedure, asleep surgery without this control process has become more and more performed, essentially thanks to the progress of neuroimaging allowing to STN visualization. However, it has been reported a relative inaccuracy between the ""radiological"" STN delimitated on several types of MRI sequences (T2, T2\*, SWI) and the per-operative electrophysiological findings. As a result, there are currently many types of STN-DBS procedures, and the lack of standardization between techniques complicates the interpretation of postoperative results on anatomical, electrophysiological and clinical points of view. Furthermore, to date, it has not been proven that asleep surgery without MER and clinical controls is as effective as the standard procedure in a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial.

NCT04357652,".Brief Summary:\* Obesity is a major public health problem in France. Indeed, 17% of the French population is obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m²) while almost half of the adult population is overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m²).

There is an increased risk of gynecological cancer in obese women but screening is less often performed :

In women, obesity is a risk factor for the occurrence of certain cancers such as uterine cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer and breast cancer, particularly post-menopausal. In addition, an increase in BMI from the first stage of obesity is associated with larger breast tumors with more frequent lymph node involvement, indicating more invasive cancers. Recent studies have shown an increase in breast cancer mortality for women with grade 2 and 3 obesity compared to women of so-called normal weight. Mortality from invasive breast cancer is higher from the obesity stage onwards.

The current recommendations of the High Authority for Health recommend breast cancer screening by mammography and clinical examination every two years in all women aged 50 to 74, excluding women at high risk and requiring specialist follow-up. Organized screening for cervical cancer has recently been modified. From 25 to 30 years of age the modalities remain the same and consist of two cytological examinations one year apart and then every 3 years if the latest results are normal. From the age of 30 and up to the age of 65, it is now recommended that an HPV test be performed as a first-line test, 3 years after the last normal cytological examination and then every 5 years if the last test was negative.

Studies dating back quite some time had shown an under-screening of cancers in obese women, in terms of carrying out mammography and cervical smears compared to women of normal weight. More recent data on access to gynecological cancer screening for obese women are heterogeneous, but there still seems to be less access to these examinations, whether for mammography or cervical smears. For example, a large American cohort study observed poorer detection of pre-cancerous lesions by smear with increasing BMI. Obese women had the lowest cumulative risk of pre-cancerous lesions at five years (followed by overweight women), but the highest rate of cancer at five years, associated with higher mortality.

A neglected contraception in obese women?

Data in the literature show that rates of unintended and unplanned pregnancies are higher in obese women (mainly those with grade 3 obesity) than in normal-weight women. This is associated with a lower use of contraception which is certainly poly-factorial: contraception not necessary due to a decrease in fertility linked to obesity, increased risks linked to contraception in obese women... However, most current contraceptive methods have shown similar efficacy in obese and non-obese women.

This context suggests that there is still a marked difference in the gynecological management of obese women. The role of the general practitioner seems essential in this follow-up by facilitating the use of screening tests and by improving the information of this population with regard to contraception in particular.

The objective of this study is to compare the gynecological follow-up of obese and non-obese women in a sample of women in Occitania, in terms of screening for breast and cervical cancer, as well as in terms of access to a method of contraception in general practice.",[],[]

NCT02605902,"Gilles da la Tourette syndrome (TS)\* is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. In most adult patients, quality of life is significantly impaired. TS, therefore, is a cost-intensive disease (in Germany: mean total costs=€3404/year). Despite significant adverse effects, dopamine receptor antagonists were recommended as first choice treatment for many years. Although efficacy could be demonstrated only recently, today, behavioral therapy with face-to-face Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) (including psychoeducation, habit reversal training, function-based assessment and intervention, and relaxation training) is recommended as first line treatment for tics. In Germany, however, dissemination of CBIT is restricted due to a considerable lack of well-trained therapists. The aim of this study is to overcome this deficiency by creating a new and sophisticated internet-delivered CBIT (iCBIT) program. In addition, internet-delivered CBIT will shorten waiting time, will reach additional groups of patients and will be - once developed and established - highly cost-effective (about € 100 vs. € 1450 for face-to-face CBIT). Investigators want to perform a multicenter, randomized, controlled, observer-blind trial including 160 adult patients in order to demonstrate that 8 sessions (10 weeks) of iCBIT are superior to internet-delivered psychoeducation/relaxation in adult patients with TS. Both immediate (1 week after end of treatment) and long-term effects (after 3 and 6 months) will be evaluated.","['dopamine receptor antagonists', 'Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)', 'iCBIT', 'internet-delivered psychoeducation/relaxation']","['', '', '', '']"

NCT02688257,"Patients with large primary operable breast cancers are offered chemotherapy prior to surgery to shrink the tumour and enable breast conserving surgery. Conventional assessment of response to chemotherapy relies on a change in tumour size which does not always correlate with the change in amount of viable tumour. Newer techniques such as functional MRI, microbubble and optoacoustic ultrasound offer the potential to detect responses to chemotherapy by evaluating functional changes in tumour vascularity and oxygenation. Neither modality utilises ionising radiation.

Although MRI is widely used for detecting breast cancer, its ability in assessing functional responses to chemotherapy prior to surgery has not been fully exploited. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI has a sensitivity around 90% and provides quantitative measurements of blood volume and flow. Other functional techniques detect variation in tissue oxygenation: this is called the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) mechanism. The BOLD technique uses a special magnetic resonance (MR) sequence called T2\* to measure the weakly magnetic effect of deoxygenated haemoglobin. The investigators wish to develop and validate T2\* measurements which relate to oxygenation of a tumour. The investigators also want to validate other MR sequences including diffusion weighted (DW) MRI, which quantifies microcirculation of blood in the capillary network and the diffusion of water within tissues.

Microbubble ultrasound is an established technique that utilises an intravenous contrast agent comprising tiny microbubbles of gas that can increase the reflectivity of blood and enhance spectral and colour Doppler signals obtained from routine ultrasound imaging. Optoacoustic imaging is new technique where the output signal depends on the oxygenation of the tissues under study. It utilises a light signal input and measures ultrasound signal output.

NCT06082544,"Loss of teeth leads to loss of function and lack of normal alveolar growth, along with unpleasant esthetics that hamper the psychosocial development of the young child. Traditionally, the management of single tooth loss in a young child is done by conservative means. The presence of large pulp chambers in incompletely mineralized immature teeth of children predisposes the pulp to loss of vitality in cases of complete coverage restorations . Hence, the clinician resorts to partial coverage prostheses such as Maryland Bridge, resin-bonded restorations, or removable prostheses in cases of multiple missing teeth. None of these treatment methods are completely satisfactory and have their drawbacks.

Partial dentures are dependent on the child's compliance. They increase the rate of decay and may cause gingival disease leading to bone resorption. Furthermore, there is a need to refabricate a new prosthesis from time to time to compensate for craniofacial growth.

Mini-screw implant placement in a young child would be an ideal method of treatment for the absence of teeth. They restore the function, preserve the alveolar bone, and give excellent esthetics, restoring the child's confidence and social acceptability. Parents are usually keen to get this treatment done as soon as offer the suggestion. To our knowledge, there is no previous study that compared the two techniques.

NCT03566069,"Intranasal administration of Oxytocin (OT) has been found to improve social communication skills and encoding of social cues. Studies indicate that the provision of OT enhances the ability to develop trust 1, to improve the benefits of social support during social stress induction tasks 2 and to increase positive communication during couples' conflict discussions 3. These studies, and many others, point to the potential beneficial effects of OT as a facilitator of relationship-focused processes such as psychotherapy. Studies assessing the effect of OT as a possible outcome enhancer in psychotherapy for clinical populations are scarce, and their findings are largely inconsistent 4. Reasons for this state of affairs include the complexity of recruitment in this population; the provision of single-dose OT, which tends to cause a lower and insufficient effect 5; and methodological constraints, such as the lack of a control group 6 or insufficient probing of interpersonal factors 7.

In this study we intend to overcome these constraints by evaluating the impact of intranasal administration of OT in patients suffering from acute stages of anxiety and depression disorders and undergoing intensive, relationship-focused psychotherapy during psychiatric hospitalization. One-hundred-and-twenty admitted patients with anxiety and depression disorders will be randomized and double-blindly allocated to two groups: (a) psychotherapy + OT (n=60), and (b) psychotherapy + placebo (n=60). Patients will be followed for three weeks, beginning at the start of their hospitalization, and will be assessed for the severity of their anxiety and depression symptoms; their working alliance with their therapist; and their treatment outcome after each session. Psychotherapy will be delivered twice a week. Intranasal OT will be administered twice a day.

This study can provide insights regarding the potential involvement of OT in the trajectories leading to the production of detectable changes in brain activity following psychotherapy. Additionally, it can support the development of an integrating model combining recent findings in psychotherapy research pertaining to the significant role of therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy outcome, and findings from neuroimaging studies. Finally, provision of OT as a psychotherapy enhancer can facilitate a rapid therapeutic response and subsequently replace aggressive psychiatric medication usage, needed to create a rapid decrease of distress during psychiatric admissions.","['Oxytocin', 'OT', 'placebo']","['oxytocin', '', '']"

As a secondary objective, this treatment will be assessed in terms of safety and tolerability.

Bioequivalence will be evaluated and verified on the basis of pharmacokinetic data. Blood samples of the volunteers will be taken at specific points in time; these samples will be analyzed using various statistical methods to establish pharmacokinetic characteristics required to compare the 2 treatments. The planned treatments with Rivaroxaban will be considered bioequivalent if specific criteria defined in the study protocol are met.

The study will be conducted in one center in Germany. 28 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will participate. They will be treated according to a single-dose, randomized, 2-way cross-over, non-placebo-controlled design.",['Rivaroxaban'],['rivaroxaban']

NCT02347579,"Complex Regional Pain syndrome Type I (CRPS-I) is a chronic progressive disease. Patients experience dramatic decline of overall well-being, despite the absence of any apparent physical cause. The main symptoms are hypersensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) and experiencing normal tactile stimulation as painful (allodynia) in the absence of peripheral nerve damage. The debate on the aetiology of CRPS-I is still open.

The therapy offered to CRPS-I patients is diverse and can involve invasive and non-invasive interventions. Current (inter)national guidelines recommend physiotherapy as the best non-invasive treatment for rehabilitation. Recently, cognitive and behavioural Graded Exposure in Vivo (GEXP) therapy aimed at reducing pain-related fear was found to be effective (De Jong et al. 2005), and more effective than standard physical therapy (ReMOVE study, articles in preparation). By reducing pain-related fear EXP might reconcile motor output and sensory feedback.

Another type of pain is lower back pain (LBP), which affects 70% to 85% of general population, but usually heals within 12 weeks in 90% of patients. The rest of the patients suffer from intractable, chronic LBP despite no evident organic abnormality. Research shows that also in these patients cognitive and behavioural aspects of pain are important and related to physical performance and self-reported disability (Vlaeyen et al., 2000). Several studies have demonstrated the success of GEXP in this patient group: GEXP resulted in improvements in pain-related fear, catastrophizing, performance of daily relevant activities, and in pain intensity (Leeuw et al., 2008).

This study aims to investigate the effect of GEXP on brain regions involved in the processing of harmless tactile stimuli in CRPS-I and CLBP patients, as well as its effect on tactile discrimination thresholds. We hypothesize that GEXP will induce 1) an improvement of tactile discrimination thresholds, 2) a functional reorganization of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (in regions related to the affected limb in CRPS-I; and to the back in LBP), 3) changes in activation of emotional brain circuits during non-noxious stimulation, 4) changes in resting state connectivity between emotional and sensory brain areas, 5) changes in measures reflecting white matter integrity. No systematic changes are expected in the healthy controls.

Patients diagnosed with CRPS-I and CLBP will participate in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) experiment. In this observational study, we examine the effects of GEXP treatment that all patients receive as part of usual care. Anatomical as well as diffusion-weighted and T2\*-weighted (Blood oxygenation level dependent) MR images will be acquired. The study has a 3x4 split plot design with group (CRPS-I patients and CLBP receiving GEXP treatment / healthy controls) as between-subjects variable and time (pre-, during, post-treatment and follow-up) as within-subject variable.",[],[]

NCT05229263,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health concern because more than 10% of the world's population have it, its prevalence is increasing, and CKD is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality for this population.

The majority of the people with CKD aren't aware and there are not available tools for early CKD detection and for an accurate prediction on these patients. Many CKD patients exhibit progressive renal dysfunction, demonstrating a failure of current, non-specific therapeutic strategies. Better methods are urgently needed for i) early diagnosis of CKD, and prediction of its progression for improved stratification of patients and better targeting of current treatments; and ii) to directly assess structural and functional responses of the kidney to new therapies and identify those patients who respond.

Over the past decade, renal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a promising technique for improved understanding and characterisation of renal pathophysiology. Compared to histopathology, MRI is non-invasive and avoids sampling bias by characterising the entire kidney with high spatial resolution.

In spite of a number of single centre studies showing renal MRI feasibility and potential to address a number of key clinical questions, current methodological differences across studies hinder reliable comparisons of the results, which can only be regarded as preliminary. Standardization of acquisition and processing protocols across centres is therefore needed, and this will also lead to the possibility to provide preliminary data of the multiparametric renal MRI clinical validity and utility.

The purpose of this study is to standardize, assess the feasibility and provide preliminary evidence of clinical validity and utility of the multiparametric renal MRI.

To reach this goal two groups of subjects are involved:

* Group 1 (healthy volunteers). In this group the repeatibility and reproducibility of multiparametric renal MRI will be assessed.
* Group 2 (CKD patients). In this group the feasibility, the acceptability, the reproducibility and the preliminary clinical validity of multiparametric renal MRI will be assessed.",[],[]
NCT05778006,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (syn. myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME/CFS) is a relatively common, but pathogenetically still insufficiently understood, complex, severe, chronic disease. It has been classified by the WHO as a neurological disorder (ICD-10 G93.3).

The leading symptoms are pathological exhaustion (fatigue) and prolonged, inadequate deterioration of condition after exertion (syn. post-exertional malaise or PEM). In addition, pain, sleep disturbances, flu-like symptoms, and cognitive, autonomic, and neuroendocrine symptoms are typically found.

In the majority of patients\*, the trigger is a viral disease, including infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is particularly common in young patients, but also influenza or coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) at any age. Causative factors are discussed to be autoimmune mechanisms as well as a genetic predisposition.

The general activity level and quality of life of patients are usually significantly reduced due to the disease. A large proportion of those affected are confined to a wheelchair, home or bed. ME/CFS is one of the most common reasons for long absences from school due to illness.

Because no reliable biomarkers are available, ME/CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnosis is made using internationally established clinical criteria and after careful differential diagnosis. To date, no causal, but only symptom-oriented, non-standard treatment approaches are found. With appropriate care, the prognosis in childhood and adolescence is better than in adults. Long-term recovery is possible in two-thirds of young patients, whereas less than one-third of adult patients can expect recovery.

In Germany, there are currently two special outpatient clinics for patients with ME/CFS, one for adult patients\* at the Charité Fatigue Centrum in Berlin, headed by Prof. Scheibenbogen, and one for children, adolescents and young adults up to 25 years of age at the ME/CFS focus of the Children's Polyclinic of the MRI of the TUM in Munich, headed by Prof. Behrends. A joint data collection of these ME/CFS centers has not been established.

The proposed ME/CFS registry study (MECFS-R) is intended to initially pool medical data from specialized routine care on a bicenter basis and, after recruitment of additional German centers, on a multicenter, longitudinal, and web-based basis, as extensive as possible, and to make this data available for research.

Following the example of already well-established European registry studies (e.g., the ESID registry of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies), digital data acquisition should take place in a tiered approach according to cost-benefit analysis. Medical institutions can decide, based on capacity, whether a clearly defined core data set (level 1) or more complex data sets (level 2 or 3) should be digitally captured. The digital implementation is to be carried out in collaboration with the Munich-based IT company Bitcare, whose database concepts have proven successful in the context of the Transplantation Cohort (Tx Cohort) of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) or the Covid-19 study of the MRI of TUM (COMRI) and with whom the team at the MRI of TUM has been working successfully for many years.

The aim of the MECFS-R is to accurately describe the clinical picture and its course in Germany clinically and epidemiologically as well as to derive epidemiological or medical risk factors, if applicable, and to define subcohorts for future treatment approaches.",[],[]

NCT04530734,"Catatonia is a severe form of psychomotor disturbance with a heterogenous presentation. It affects approximately 10% of acute psychiatric inpatients. According to the fifth edition of DSM-5 the diagnosis of catatonia can be made when three or more symptoms from the twelve following are present : catalepsy, waxy flexibility, stupor, agitation, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerisms, stereotypies, grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia. It can occur in various psychiatric diseases, including mood disorders or schizophrenia, but also in various non-psychiatric disorders \[metabolic disturbances, viral infections (including HIV), typhoid fever, heat stroke, and autoimmune disease\].

Benzodiazepines, especially LORAZEPAM, are the most common initial treatment, with a remission rate of approximately 70-80 %, regardless of the cause or the clinical manifestations. This first line treatment is titrated gradually according to the therapeutic response over a few days up to 20-25 mg per day. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is initiated on patients with catatonia who do not respond to benzodiazepines.

Interestingly, pharmacogenetic variants can alter the metabolism of lorazepam (e.g., the UGT2B15 \* 2 allele slows it down).

The main objective of this study is to assess the link between clinical response to lorazepam, residual plasma concentrations of lorazepam after 72 hours of fixed dosage, and the existence of genetic polymorphisms modifying the metabolism of lorazepam. Our hypothesis is that non-responding patients have lowered blood concentrations of lorazepam associated to a genetic profile of rapid metabolism.

NCT05701267,"Background of the study:

Major depressive disorder is a severe neuropsychiatric condition that affects approximately 15% to 18% of people worldwide during their lifetime (Malhi \& Mann, 2018). Selection of the optimal treatment is difficult.

A certain correlation (functional / structural, vascular or a mix of both) is expected between clinical data (obtained from psychometric tests such as the HDRS and psychiatric evaluations) and MRI parameters (functional activity, structural connectivity, anatomical variations, perfusion / diffusion etc.).

Objective of the study:

Identification of MRI-based biomarkers to predict clinical outcome of major depressive disorder in comparison with healthy controls. Outcome is defined by level of depressive and cognitive symptomatology and related comorbidity.

Study design:

An independent treating physician will inform a potentially eligible patient and ask whether he/she is interested in voluntary participation in the study. If he/she is interested, the independent treating physician will refer the patient to one of the clinicians from the GGz who is also involved in the Neurotrend study for further steps such as providing the information letter / informed consent and scheduling an intake interview at least one week after receiving all necessary information. Healthy controls will be recruited through public advertisement and via the website www.neurotrend.nl. Pilot subjects will be recruited from the Eindhoven University community and via the website www.neurotrend.nl. Both groups, healthy controls and pilot subjects, will have at least one week to consider and decide on participation. One week later an intake session will take place in which the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked. During this session, patients can also ask questions about the study and the informed consent will be signed if the participant is willing to participate voluntarily in the study. Subsequently at the end of the intake session, a starting (baseline) date will be planned for this participant . The actual participation starts at baseline. In total, 120 depressed patients and 60 healthy controls will participate in the study.

Each participant visits Kempenhaeghe twice, whereby each session, is dedicated to complete questionnaires and cognitive tests, such as memory tasks and eye tracking. In the last hour, the participant will be scanned (MRI). Two weeks before each visit, the participant has to fill in some questionnaires that have been sent to the participant.

Study population:

120 patients with major depressive disorder and 60 healthy controls\*.

\* Inclusion of up to 30 healthy ""pilot"" participants for technical evaluation. See above.

Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

* Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores
* Treatment / medication usage
* MRI metrics (varies per MRI modality, an example is volume per region for a T1-weighted scan and fractional anisotropy for diffusion-weighted scans).

Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):

* Scores of psychometric assessments (e.g. STAI-DY1 - anxiety score)
* Scores of cognitive assessments (e.g. average response time for the eye-tracking task)

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness (if applicable):

The participant burden is low and is divided into an intake session and two research sessions. The MRI scan is non-invasive, and subjects can indicate that they want to stop the scan at any time during the scan by squeezing a type of balloon that will lie next to the subject in the case that they feel uncomfortable or for any other reason. Subjects with MRI contraindications (e.g.

claustrophobia, pregnancy or implants not suitable for MRI) are already excluded in advance and will therefore not participate in the study at all. Mostly, the subjects will lie still during the scan, except for one affective task in which they will be asked to match different emotional faces for about 5 minutes.The cognitive tests will only consist of memory, reaction speed, attention, and processing speed tasks which in total, do not last more than 30 minutes.

NCT02863276,"Background Surgical injury provokes a stress response. These pathways mediated by stress hormones and cytokines cause a catabolic state. The loss of body cell mass may result in prolonged convalescence and increased morbidity. Protein catabolism after colorectal surgery is even more increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Epidural blockade, by reducing the intensity of the catabolic response, improves substrate utilization after surgery in non-diabetic patients. This effect is even more pronounced in diabetic patients receiving amino acids.

The aim of the study is to explore the effect of two different protocols to manage blood glucose control on glucose and protein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing colon surgery and receiving epidural analgesia and perioperative feeding with amino acids. The following hypotheses are tested:

1. Tight perioperative blood glucose control with intensified insulin therapy compared to standard blood glucose control in presence of general anesthesia with epidural analgesia and amino acid infusion would reduce endogenous glucose production and leucine oxidation.
2. Tight blood glucose control and perioperative infusion of amino acids induce a more positive protein balance compared to standard blood glucose control by better oxidative glucose utilization and redirecting amino acids from oxidative to synthetic pathways.

Material and Methods A total of 20 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing elective colorectal surgery will be admitted to the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive standard blood glucose control (blood glucose target \<10 mmol\*l-1; control group; cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) group, n=8) or to receive tight blood glucose control with intensified insulin therapy (blood glucose target\<6 mmol\*l-1; intensified insulin group; II group, n=8). All patients will receive general anesthesia and an epidural catheter for perioperative analgesia. During surgery (intraoperative state) and immediately after surgery (postoperative state) when receiving an amino acid infusion protein and glucose kinetics will be assessed using a stable isotope technique with L-\[1-13C\]leucine and \[6,6-2H2\]glucose and circulating concentrations of glucose, glucagon, insulin and cortisol will be measured. The primary endpoints of the study will be protein balance. Sample size is set to ensure at least 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.","['insulin', 'amino acids', 'cortisol']","['insulin human', '', 'hydrocortisone']"

NCT01507623,"Propofol is widely used by anaesthesiologists for deep sedation and general anaesthesia. During recent years nurses trained in the use of low dose Propofol sedation (NAPS) during endoscopy have been introduced. The method has been implemented at the endoscopic unit at Gentofte hospital since 2008(1). Propofol has a respiratory depressive effect which may result in depressed oxygen saturation in the blood (hypoxia). Due to a short acting half life this is prevented in the majority of cases. However, in spite of this, hypoxia is experienced in 4,4% of patients receiving propofol during endoscopy at Gentofte Hospital (unpublished data). It is well known that hypoxia constitutes a late expression of reduced oxygen tension in peripheral tissues. Whether the addition of capnography to standard monitoring during NAPS may be of benefit is widely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine whether the additional use of capnography to standard monitoring during endoscopy may improve patient safety in patients undergoing low dose Propofol sedation by reducing the number, duration and level of hypoxic events.

NCT02179125,"Rationale: The PneumRx RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil (RePneu LVR-coil) is a bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment designed to compress the areas of lung parenchyma most damaged by emphysema. The LVRC treatment was found to be feasible, safe and effective in previous studies. However, patient-based outcomes besides quality of life questionnaires are hardly measured after intervention treatments for COPD. Furthermore, the exact underlying physiological mechanism of the LVR-coil treatment is unknown. Another aspect of the treatment which we to date do not fully understand is which group of patients benefit of the treatment and which group of patients do not, this knowing that the responder rate is already about 60%.

Objective: The objectives of the study are to gain more knowledge on 1) the effect of the LVRC treatment on patient-based outcomes like physical activity, 2) the underlying physiological mechanism of the treatment, 3) the predictors of response to the treatment at baseline, and 4) on a targetted treatment number of coils to be placed per lung using lung compliance.

Study design: This study is a non-randomised open label multi-center intervention study.

Study population: The study population exists of adult patients with severe emphysema with no other treatment options left besides surgical procedures.

Intervention: Bilateral bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment with RePneu coils.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoint is the change in physical activity between baseline and 3 months follow-up after the second treatment. The secondary endpoints are the changes between baseline and 3 months follow-up after the second treatment in: patient reported outcomes of the treatment, dynamic lung hyperinflation, static lung volumes, lung compliance, diaphragm function, lung perfusion, systemic inflammation and small airways function.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The LVR Coil has been designed to be as safe as possible. It was shown that the risks associated with the LVRC system are largely attributable to the bronchoscopic procedure itself rather than to the device per se. Therefore, it appears that the LVRC device itself does not appreciably increase the risk of serious adverse events beyond the risk of undergoing a bronchoscopy procedure or simply having emphysema. Currently, this treatment is not commercially available in the Netherlands and study participants will have to visit the hospital multiple times. Previous studies have shown that the treatment has beneficial effect for the patient, however not all patients respond. Part of this new study is to try to identify which group of patients respond to the treatment and which patients do not. Therefore, it is possible that a patient will not receive any benefits from the treatment.","['RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil', 'LVRC']","['', '']"

NCT00908830,"Lung transplantation is a life saving procedure for patients with a terminal lung disease such as cystic fibrosis. Approximately, one in 3,500 children in the United States are born with cystic fibrosis each year with the predicted survival reaching 36.9 years in 2006. Cystic fibrosis was the third lead indication for lung transplantation in 2006. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that can affect the way the body can remove salt from various organs. It results in mucus blocking the ducts of the lungs and pancreas leading to inability to handle oxygen and malabsorption of nutrients. Malabsorption is a common complication of cystic fibrosis that can affect the way the anti-rejection medications are absorbed. One medication that is utilized after transplant to prevent rejection is mycophenolate mofetil. This medication may not be absorbed adequately in this population due to their disease thus placing these patients at increased risk of rejection. At the investigators' institution, all transplant patients are initiated at the same mycophenolate dose regardless of their underlying disease. The limited available literature regarding cystic fibrosis transplant patients and mycophenolate suggests that these patients require higher doses due to their erratic absorption. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of mycophenolate mofetil on the body in lung transplant patients who have cystic fibrosis in efforts to improve survival outcomes.",['mycophenolate mofetil'],['mycophenolate mofetil']
NCT03184597,"Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) include mild maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and severe cutaneous reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). cADRs are considered as a major public health issue because of their potentially life-threatening morbidity, especially severe cutaneous reactions. The incidence of SJS/TEN is estimated to vary from 1 in 1,000 to 10,000 drug exposures, and its mortality is as high as 35%. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly those with aromatic ring structures such as carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), lamotrigine (LTG), phenobarbital (PB), and phenytoin (PHT), are among the most common causes of severe cutaneous reactions. The incidence of AED-induced SJS was estimated as 0.2% and all cases occurred in individuals receiving aromatic AEDs.

Previous studies have validated that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele HLA-B\*15:02 is strongly associated with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in southern Han Chinese and populations in southeast Asia. Our recent studies indicated that HLA-A\*24:02 is a common genetic risk factor for CBZ-, LTG-, and PHT-induced SJS/TEN. It is also associated with MPE. Additionally, another four alleles, including HLA-B\*15:01, HLA-B\*15:11, HLA-A\*02:01,and HLA-DRB1\*01:01, were showed to be potential risk factors for aromatic AEDs-induced SJS/TEN. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration issued the safety alert that recommended HLA-B\*15:02 screening for people with Asian ancestry before starting CBZ, and avoidance of the drug if the test is positive. Subsequent studies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand demonstrated that HLA-B\*15:02 screening before commencing CBZ can significantly reduce the incidence of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN. However, the overall incidence of AEDs-induced SJS/TEN remained unchanged in Hong Kong, as PHT-induced SJS/TEN increased when CBZ-SJS/TEN decreased. Moreover, no study focuses on the incidences of AEDs-induced cADRs with and without HLA screening before commencing aromatic AEDs. Therefore, we are planning to conduct a multicenter prospective study to examine the reduction of AEDs-induced cADRs after the HLA screening prior to the beginning of aromatic AEDs administration.","['carbamazepine', 'oxcarbazepine', 'lamotrigine', 'phenobarbital', 'phenytoin']","['carbamazepine', 'oxcarbazepine', 'lamotrigine', 'phenobarbital', 'phenytoin']"

NCT06439641,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are an inflammatory disease that can affect the entire digestive tract from the mouth to the anus for CD and the entire colon and rectum for UC. They mainly affect adolescents and young adults. These pathologies evolve in relapses interspersed with phases of remission. Sometimes associated with extraintestinal manifestations (joint, dermatological, ophthalmological or biliary systems), chronic inflammation of the digestive tract and the resulting symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal syndrome, etc.) lead to a significant alteration in the quality of life of patients in all spheres of activity (professional, sexual, social).

Sleep is a basic neurophysiological state, the normal total duration of which in humans is between six and ten hours per day. It is an essential element of the circadian rhythm in humans, influencing certain cellular functions and in particular the synthesis of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules (Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young in 2017). Sleep disturbances and disruption of the circadian rhythm lead to metabolic and immunological dysfunctions, which may be involved in chronic inflammatory conditions through changes in the immune response.

In the field of IBD, many studies suggest poor sleep quality in patients with IBD. While there seems to be a link between sleep disorders and impaired quality of life with a socio-professional impact in these patients, the links between IBD activity, its treatment and sleep disorders are poorly studied, with discordant results in previous studies.

In order to enrich our knowledge on this topic, the investigators wish to study the prevalence and risk factors associated with sleep disorders in IBD patients in order to improve patients' quality of life","['IBD', ""Crohn's disease"", 'Ulcerative colitis']","['', '', '']"
NCT05349799,"Prospective, low-interventional, multicentric, open-labelled study to assess the performance and safety of skin beautification treatment by TEOSYAL RHA® 1 for fine lines in the neck, perioral region, and smiling lines including an exploratory arm with TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity 1 to assess skin redensification.

Treatment phase - skin beautification:

At Visit 1 (Baseline), subjects will be injected with TEOSYAL RHA® 1 in the fine lines (Neck lines and Perioral and/or Smiling lines) depending on wrinkle severity assessed by the Principal Investigator (PI) at baseline using a specific grading scale for each indication.

The subject will be included in the study if he has been graded 2 or 3 on the Neck Lines Descriptive Scale (NLDS) at baseline.

Then:

1. The subject will be included in the perioral rhytids cohort if he has been graded 2 or 3 on the Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale (PR-SRS) at baseline.
2. The subject will be included in the smiling lines cohort if he has been graded 3 or 4 on the Smiling Lines Descriptive Scale (SLDS) at baseline.

Each indication represent one cohort and all subjects will be included in the neck lines cohort.

Thus, Subject participating to the study may be treated for:

* Neck Lines and perioral Lines (2 cohorts)
* Neck Lines and Smiling Lines (2 cohorts)
* Neck Lines, Perioral Lines and Smiling Lines (3 cohorts)

An optional touch-up will be performed at Visit 2 (Month 1 +/- 1 week) if deemed necessary to achieve an optimal correction.

Exploratory phase - skin redensification:

After treatment with TEOSYAL RHA® 1, subjects will be randomized to the second phase of the study (starting at month 2 +/- 1 week): 5/6 of the subjects will enter the exploratory part of the study during which TEOSYAL® PureSense Redensity 1 (RHA1+R1 treated Group) will be assessed for skin redensification. The rest of the subjects will not receive any additional treatment for the rest of the study (RHA1 only treated group/around 11 subjects).

Note: the number of sessions treated with Redensity 1 might be adapted depending on subject treatment needs in order to achieve optimal results. This will be at PI discretion.

Subjects in the RHA+R1 treated Group will be also randomized into 2 subgroups of 28 subjects as described below:

* Sub-Group A: injection with a needle for all indications
* Sub-Group B: injection with a cannula for neck lines and smiling lines indications\* \*The perioral indication will be treated with a needle for this group.

Increasing amount of data based on animal studies support the pathogenic role of tissue hypoxia in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Pharmacists are front line primary healthcare professionals who see patients with diabetes frequently and in Alberta, they have been allowed to prescribe medications and order laboratory tests. As such, pharmacists could systematically identify poorly controlled diabetes patients and provide greater access to diabetes interventions to improve blood sugar control.

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a community pharmacist intervention on blood sugar control in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes.

Project description:

100 adults with type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled blood sugar will be defined by the participating pharmacists. Blood sugar control is going to assessed using hemoglobin A1c test (a blood test to measure individual's blood sugar control over the last 3 months). This test requires obtaining a blood spot from the patient which will be obtained by pricking his/her fingertip. Based on the hemoglobin A1c test result the pharmacist will assess the patient's need for insulin glargine, if the patient needs insulin glargine the pharmacist is going to prescribe it for him/her and educate him/her on its use. Patients are going to be followed up closely by the pharmacists for 6 months with regular updates to the patients' family physicians.

NCT01736540,"Iron, one of the most common elements in nature and the most abundant transition metal in the body, is readily capable of accepting and donating electrons. This capability makes iron a useful component of various, essential biochemical processes. Despite the essential role of iron, the excess of iron is toxic to the human body. It is critical for the human body to maintain iron balance, since humans have no physiologic mechanism for actively removing iron from the body.

The development of iron overload occurs when iron intake exceeds the body's capacity to safely store the iron in the liver, which is the primary store for iron. Long-term transfusion therapy, a life-giving treatment for patients with intractable chronic anemia is currently the most frequent cause of secondary iron overload.

The mounting evidence regarding the mortality and morbidity due to chronic iron overload in transfusion dependent anaemias has led to the establishment of guidelines that aim the improvement of patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted in order to assess the impact of iron overload in patients with acquired anaemias.

In this study, non-invasive R2- and T2\*-MRI techniques were applied to the liver and the heart, respectively, to complement the primary variable (serum ferritin) assessed in patients with various transfusion-dependent anaemias. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and severity of cardiac and liver siderosis in patients with transfusional siderosis.

NCT04255121,"During labor, pain is systematic. In France, epidural analgesia is the gold standard to fight pain.

Sometimes, emergency situations involve the maternal or fetal prognosis and require an emergency fetal extraction by caesarean. When an effective epidural analgesia is in place, an injection of adrenaline lidocaine converts this epidural analgesia into an epidural anesthesia allowing a surgical procedure. Sometimes, the time required to set up the anesthesia cannot be expected and a general anesthesia is performed.

Local anesthetics used during epidural analgesia have Pka between 7.8 and 8.1. In solution, local anesthetics exist in two forms: an un-ionized form and an ionized form. The non-ionized form is liposoluble and crosses the lipid membranes to reach the site of intracellular action. The non-ionized form conditions the time taken to install anesthesia.

When the pH of the solution is equal to Pka, un-ionized and ionized form are present in equal quantity. Commercial local anesthetic solutions have acidic pH and so contained a majority of ionized form. Alkalinization of local anesthetics solution should bring the pH closer to pKa and therefore to favor a greater proportion of non-ionized form.","['epidural analgesia', 'adrenaline', 'lidocaine', 'local anesthetics']","['', '', 'lidocaine', '']"
NCT04642430,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) affects 200,000 Canadians and increases risk of stroke, morbidity and mortality. Having a stroke can affect a patient's ability to speak, eat, walk, work, care for themselves, and interact with others. Not only can it ruin one's life, but it can also be fatal. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot, depriving brain cells of oxygen. In people with atrial fibrillation, blood flow is sluggish in the top chambers of the heart, and blood clots can form there. When a piece of a clot breaks off, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. That's where blood thinners come in. Blood thinners, or anticoagulants, decrease the chances of blood clots forming in the heart, reducing the risk of stroke. Studies show that blood thinners are highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke by up to 95%.

The conventional blood thinner is warfarin, taken by mouth. Warfarin requires regular blood tests to make sure a patient getting the correct dose. The patient also may have to avoid certain foods since the medication can interact with them. Newer blood thinners, known as direct-oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are available, which do not require regular blood tests and do not interact with foods. Two of the new blood thinners are called rivaroxaban and apixaban. Like warfarin, they can be taken by mouth, and studies have shown them to be as effective as warfarin.

Both rivaroxaban and apixaban have been approved for stroke prevention in AF by Health Canada. However, there have been no direct head-to-head comparisons of these two anticoagulants, meaning comparative safety data is not available. Increasing use of DOACs for stroke prevention in AF and patient values around bleeding highlight the need for a comparison trial to ensure patients receive the anticoagulant with the greatest balance of benefit to potential harm.

The trial is to assess bleeding rates and superiority of using apixaban versus rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.","['warfarin', 'rivaroxaban', 'apixaban']","['warfarin', 'rivaroxaban', 'apixaban']"

NCT06361732,"It is known that Immunosuppression post-Liver transplant is central to achieving optimal outcomes in liver transplant recipients. It is required to maintain an adequate balance between reducing rejection and toxicities. Mainstay drugs for maintenance therapy are Calcinuerin inhibitors - Tacrolimus versus cyclosporine. Tacrolimus is preferred, as it has less rejection and better graft survival. However, there is risk of renal and metabolic toxicities. Tacrolimus is bound mainly to alpha1-acid-glycoprotein (encoded by the ABCB1gene) expressed on various epithelial and endothelial cells and lymphocytes. Elimination occurs by metabolizing enzymes of cytochrome P450 system, with biliary excretion (95%) of metabolites (majority) with minority through urine (2.4%). Demethylation and hydroxylation of tacrolimus occurs by hepatic and intestinal CYP3A isoforms (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Among the factors that play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, thus affecting the tacrolimus trough levels in the body and in turn influencing the dosing of the drug required to maintain an adequate balance between reducing rejection and toxicities, genetics plays an important role. Increased expression of CYP3A5 causes more metabolism of tacrolimus and hence affecting the tacrolimus concentration/weight-adjusted dose (C/W-D) ratio in the body. The wild type (CYP3A5\*3) are slow metabolizers and mutant ones (CYP3A5 \*1/\*1 and CYP3A5 \*1/\*3) are fast metabolizers. Fast

metabolizers have a low C/W-D ratio and require higher Tacrolimus dosing and are thus susceptible to renal and metabolic toxicities, EBV viremia and post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Polymorphisms in ABCB1 (c.3435C\>T) are also known to influence tacrolimus dosage in the first week of transplant (C/D ratio was lower in ABCB1 3435CC in comparison to CT and TT).

For this study, we invite patients suffering from mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome who have progressed after initial therapy or have failed to respond to previous therapy.

Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are cancers in which lymphocytes\* become malignant (cancerous) and affect the skin. In mycosis fungoides, the disease is generally limited to the skin, and people develop flat or raised areas on their skin where the lymphocytes have accumulated. Sometimes even larger aggregations of lymphocytes occur in the skin or lymph nodes, resulting in tumors. In Sézary syndrome, the skin is often reddened or itchy, and some abnormal lymphocytes circulate in the blood.

\* Lymphocytes are a type of immune cells that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the blood. Lymphocytes have a number of roles in the immune system, including the production of antibodies and other substances that fight infections and other diseases.

In standard practice, the disease will be treated with conventional chemotherapy that unfortunately has a limited lasting benefit. In this study, we want to see if a new treatment option can optimize and improve response and make benefit last as long as possible. This new treatment option is immunotherapy, using atezolizumab (Tecentriq).

Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal cells that may help cancer cell grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Atezolizumab blocks a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) from binding to its receptor found on the surface of lymphocytes. It helps to restore the immune activity of the body against the cancer.

Atezolizumab is already used to treat adults with a cancer that affects the bladder and the urinary system, called urothelial carcinoma, and a cancer that affects the lungs, called non-small cell lung cancer.

In this trial, patients will receive atezolizumab for one year unless the tumor starts growing again or this is not considered suitable for them anymore or they wish to stop the treatment.","['atezolizumab', 'Tecentriq']","['atezolizumab', 'atezolizumab']"

NCT06362629,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent rashes and itching, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients and brings heavy economic burden to society. The Treat to Target (T2T) strategy was proposed to guide optimal use of systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe AD, and it is emphasized patients' adherence and combined evaluation from both health providers and patients. While effective treatments for AD are available, non-adherence of treatment is common in clinical practice due to the patients' unawareness of self-evaluation and lack of concern about the specific follow-up time points in clinics, which leads to the treatment failure and repeated relapse of AD.

Hypothesis: An Artificial Intelligence assistant decision-making system (AIADMS) with implementation of the T2T framework could help control the disease progression and improve the clinical outcomes for AD.

Overall objectives:

We aim to develop an AIADMS in the form of smartphone app to integrate T2T approach for both clinicians and patients, and design clinical trials to verify the effectiveness and safety of the app. Methods: This project consists of three parts, AI training model for diagnosis and severity grading of AD based on deep learning, development of Artificial Intelligence assistant decision-making system (AIADMS) in the form of app, and design of a randomized controlled trial to verify the effectiveness and safety of AIADMS App for improvement of the clinical outcomes in AD patients.

Expected results: With application of AIADMS based app, the goal of T2T for patients with AD could be realized better, the prognosis could be improved, and more satisfaction could be achieved for both patients and clinicians.

Impact: This is the first AIADMS based app for AD management running through thediagnosis, patients' self-participation, medical follow-up, and evaluation of achievement of goal of T2T.","['Artificial Intelligence assistant decision-making system', 'systemic therapies']","['', '']"

This imaging is useful for diagnosing and assessing lymphedema. ICG lymphography has a higher sensitivity and specificity than lymphoscintigraphy, the current gold standard imaging device for lymphedema. ICG lymphography precisely and reliably diagnoses, tracks, and stages lymphedema severity, ranging from subclinical or early lymphedema to more advanced cases. The ICG contrast dye used to visualize the lymphatic system takes approximately six hours to plateau. Therefore, patients must wait six hours between their initial and delayed scans.

The purpose of this study is to determine if exercising on a Nu-step device between ICG initial and delayed scans would shorten the period of time a patient had to spend at the hospital on the day of their ICG lymphography.

The general procedures for this involve (after selecting subjects, consenting subjects, educating the subject on the protocol, along with other appropriate measures):

* Taking baseline vitals (HR \& SpO2) and limb circumference measurements
* 5-minute period of time to acquaint subject with the exercise equipment (Nu-Step) at any level of exertion
* injection of contrast agent to allow for visualization of the superficial lymphatic system by a qualified nurse
* Initial scan
* A 5-minute period of exercise at ""moderate"" level of exercise (This correlates to the rating of perceived exertion levels of 12-13; All exercise periods should be at this level and will be monitored by a provider)

NCT05813860,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease of the intestine. Infliximab (IFX) is a kind of one of the anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (anti-TNF) and is the main clinical treatment drug for Crohn's disease, but approximately 30-50% of patients develop a secondary non-response to respond within one year. The main cause of secondary non-response failure is the formation of anti-IFX anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene is a complex allele that has been associated with susceptibility to a variety of diseases. Studies have shown that HLADQA1\*05 allele carriage significantly increases the immunogenicity of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (anti-TNF) and the risk of ADA formation, resulting in a significant reduction in the efficacy of IFX. Our previous retrospective study found an increased risk of ADA, IFX failure to respond and discontinuation in patients with HLADQA1\*05 variants, and that IFX in combination with immunosuppression improved clinical outcomes in wild-type genotype patients, whereas combination therapy in patients with variant genotype did not optimize clinical outcomes significantly. Therefore, we believe that the impact of HLADQA1\*05 on the efficacy of IFX in the Chinese population is unclear, and the combination of immunosuppressants in patients with variant HLADQA1\*05 genotype remains to be validated due to insufficient sample size. We hypothesized that HLADQA1\*05 wild-type CD patients would have better clinical remission when treated with IFX than HLADQA1\*05 variant patients and that the combination of immunosuppressants would improve the outcome in wild-type patients but not in variant patients. By advancing this project, we hope to provide high quality evidence on the clinical use of IFX in Crohn's disease in the Chinese population and help physicians to be more selective in the use of IFX alone or in combination with azathioprine, or to switch treatment in a timely manner.","['Infliximab', 'anti-tumor necrosis factor agents', 'anti-TNF', 'azathioprine']","['infliximab', '', '', 'azathioprine']"

NCT04988828,"Introduction: Approximately 35% patients can not return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction(ACLR). Persistent quadriceps weakness is a factor that prevents patients return to sports. Pre-operative quadriceps strength is a predictor for the outcomes after ACLR. Therefore, enhancing pre-operative quadriceps is important. However, current prehabilitation can not well restore quadriceps strength may be due to quadricep inhibition. Whole body vibration was proposed as a promising intervention to increase muscle strength and modulate quadriceps inhibition simultaneously. Therefore, this study aim to investigate if whole body vibration has the efficacy of enhancing pre-operative quadriceps and modulating quadricep inhibition in patients with ACL injuries.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was designed. Patients with primary ACL injuries, age from 18-45 yrs, BMI\<29, physically active who awaiting ACLR will be included. Patients with any previous lower-limb injuries within 1 year, any cardiovascular or metabolic disorders will be excluded. All the subjects in this study have to finish their routine 5 week prehabilitation as well as the interventions. The primary outcomes of this study include quadriceps strength and quadriceps central activation ratio. Secondary outcomes include the score of IKDC and ACL-RSI, as well as the concentrations of myokines in serum.",[],[]

This suppression of inflammation may be related to the inhibition of NF-kB polyphenols, where its activation is related to the stimulation of 150 stimuli including cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, THF-α, GM-CSF, MCP-1), TLRs, among others. There may be other additional mechanisms that can help control virus-induced respiratory pathologies, among which are the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with tissue destruction caused by the virus and a selective antiviral action can be reported. direct.

The standardized P2Et extract obtained from C. spinosa, by the Immunobiology Group of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, is highly antioxidant, decreases lipid peroxidation and tissue damage and induces complete autophagy in stressed or tumor cells. The induction of a full autophagic flow could inhibit the replication of beta-coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, P2Et can decrease the factors involved in tissue damage by reducing IL-6 and decrease ILC2 cells of the lung in animals with lung metastases (unpublished data).

These antecedents suggest that the supplementation of patients with COVID-19 with the extract P2Et, could improve their general condition and decrease the inflammatory mediators and the viral load.","['polyphenols', 'NF-kB polyphenols', 'IL-1β', 'IL-6', 'THF-α', 'GM-CSF', 'MCP-1', 'TLRs', 'P2Et extract', 'C. spinosa', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'ILC2']","['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

NCT02356432,"Anticoagulants are generally recognized as a necessary therapy to prevent the recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), but in some patients they also cause bleedings, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. One of the independent predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage is the presence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs); a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is reported in patients with multiple CMBs. Recent study suggested that patients who had CMBs at baseline developed more new CMBs after 2 years (26%), compared with patients (12%) who did not have CMBs at baseline. However, there has been no study on the progression of CMBs in patients receiving so-called novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

This study tests the hypothesis that the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke is lower in patients receiving NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) than in those receiving warfarin, and this difference reflects the difference in the effects of warfarin and NOACs on the progression of CMBs. Towards this goal, we enroll 200 patients with at least one CMB detected by 1.5 T MRI (T2\*WI) at baseline, who treated with NOACs or warfarin for 12 months. Primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an increased number of CMBs at Month 12 of treatment with NOACs or warfarin.

NCT04922359,"Spinal surgery often involves multiple segments. The trauma of surgery is large, the duration of postoperative pain is long, and the pain is severe. Therefore, the use of opioids in perioperative period is large.

Intravenous lidocaine has been proved to be effective in reducing the dosage of opioids during the perioperative period of gastrointestinal surgery and promoting the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, there are few studies on the application of lidocaine during the perioperative period of spinal surgery, especially the impact on postoperative gastrointestinal function.

NCT00352599,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 3500 individuals. Half of people with NF1 inherit the condition from a parent, and half have a new occurrence of the condition. The manifestation of NF1 is highly variable and multiple organ systems are typically affected. Some of the more common symptoms include benign neurofibromas, café au lait spots, Lisch nodules (tan spots on the iris of the eye). Some individuals with NF1 also exhibit more severe associated conditions, such as optic pathway tumors (gliomas) or bones bending or curving. Neurocognitive deficits and specific learning disabilities occur in approximately 30 to 50% of individuals with NF1 and are regarded by some observers and sufferers to be among the most troubling features of a disease. The most commonly reported findings are deficits in visuoperceptual ability, motor coordination, expressive and receptive language, and executive functioning, which requires intact short-term memory and attention. Patients with NF1 also show a slight depression in mean IQ scores compared to healthy adults without the disorder.

While cognitive deficits are now a widely-recognized feature of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), the precise cause of these deficits still remain to be determined. Dr. Alcino Silva, a co- investigator on this study, has developed an animal model of NF1 in which mice have a specific mutation of the \*NF1\* gene.

NCT05910996,"In December 2019, cases of a novel lung disease, later referred to as COVID-19, were first reported in China. The virus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent. Due to the sharp increase in the number of cases worldwide, a pandemic outbreak was declared by WHO in March 2020.

The infection presents with a broad clinical spectrum. Frequently, there is respiratory infection with fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%), and muscle pain (7%), but completely asymptomatic infection is also possible. Severe courses may be associated with pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care.

In the context of intensive care therapy, it is sometimes necessary to use extracorporeal organ replacement procedures due to increasing lung failure. In this context, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used during the pandemic. With this procedure it is possible to replace on the one hand the oxygenation and ventilation function of the lung and on the other hand additionally the pumping function of the heart, if configured appropriately. The switch from venovenous (vv) configuration, with which only lung function is replaced, to venoarterial (va) configuration (lung function and heart function are replaced) is made in cases of intensive care necessity, e.g., increasing decompensation of heart failure.

Heart failure manifests itself, among other things, through insufficient pumping function of the heart muscle. This results in an undersupply of peripheral tissues with arterial blood, leading to increased anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are used as surrogate parameters of this undersupply. Increased oxygen depletion from oxygen available in arterial blood is detected by the surrogate parameter central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2).

In addition to ECMO, drug interventions are also used to improve cardiorespiratory performance at various doses. As described by Suwalski et al, there may be a relationship between this drug therapy and conversion from vv to va ECMO.

Currently, few studies exist on conversion from vv-ECMO to va-ECMO. In this regard, Suwalski et al. describe a population that experienced any ECMO therapy for a maximum period of 16.5 ± 10.0 days, with the group with conversion receiving 17.8 ± 10.5 days of therapy and the group without conversion receiving 16.4 ± 9.4 days. The need for conversion to va-ECMO requires additional expertise that is not readily available despite acute intensive care transport readiness. It is likely that by predicting the need for conversion, early logistical planning for transfer to an appropriate center with experience and equipment can occur, or if transfer is not necessary, staffing and equipment preparation can occur earlier and more safely. As described by Falk et al, planned and prepared conversion can also be expected to have an impact on patient\* survival.

The aim of this retrospective, exploratory data analysis is to predict conversion before placement of vv-ECMO within 30 days from ICU care from vv-ECMO to va-ECMO in COVID-19 patients.","['ECMO', 'va-ECMO', 'vv-ECMO', 'B-type natriuretic peptide', 'Surrogate parameters', 'Lactate']","['', '', '', '', '', 'lactic acid']"

NCT05646901,"Overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent worldwide. These bodyweight disorders are closely related to deficiencies in the control of food intake. A potential yet unexplored mechanism to explain the loss of eating control is the interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain. The mechanisms underlying the communication between the gut microbiome and the host remain largely unexplored. These mechanisms could occur in part through small non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression.

Two hypotheses have been proposed:

I. The interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain and its associated epigenetic changes play an important role in the overweight-related loss of eating control and metabolic imbalance.

II.The composition and functionality of the gut microbiota are associated with circulating microRNAs and glycemic variability and modify the effect of physical activity on cognitive parameters and brain microstructure (R2\*).

The study includes a cross-sectional design (comparison of subjects with and without obesity) to evaluate parameters associated with food addiction through validated questionnaires. The metabolic and behavioral profiles of the cohort will be characterized. The medial prefrontal cortex connectivity will be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The composition and functionality of the gut metagenome of the subjects will be analyzed in association with metabolic and behavioral parameters and imaging data. miRNAs can act as mediators of epigenomics of the effects of the metagenome that impact the brain, therefore it will be analyzed a broad profile of miRNAs circulating in plasma.",[],[]

NCT06100848,"The study's null hypothesis posits no significant difference in bacterial levels in the dental office environment before and after implementing hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) fumigation. The study comprised 30 participants, 18 females and 12 males, all diagnosed with moderate caries decay (ICDAS 3 and 4) in their mandibular molars, averaging 42.2 ± 8.3 years in age. Sample size calculations for 30 microbiological plates in each group utilized G\*Power software (Kiel University, Germany), factoring in prior research, with a significance level of 0.05, effect size (d) of 0.72, 95% confidence interval, and 85% power. Aerobic bacterial content in the dental office air was assessed using the Koch sedimentation method. The study employed 60 Petri dishes with Columbia Agar and 5% Sheep Blood. During caries treatment, thirty plates were opened and sealed 40 minutes later, while another set of thirty plates was opened and closed 60 minutes post-fumigation. Measurements were taken 1 meter above the ground and 2 meters from the patient's mouth. After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C, microbiological contamination was calculated as CFUs (colony-forming units) in one cubic meter using the formula: L = a × 1000 / (πr² × k). Fumigation involved a 20-minute treatment with 6% hydrogen peroxide biosanitizer (Saniswiss, Switzerland) via a compressed air device (Fumi-Jet, Kormed, Poland). The process included 3 minutes of fumigation and a 17-minute waiting period for the chemotoxic effect, with 45 ml of 6% hydrogen peroxide sprayed in a 20 m² room.",['hydrogen peroxide'],['hydrogen peroxide']

NCT00216086,"Preoperative induction chemotherapy has been successfully used in a variety of malignancies and provides several advantages over postoperative therapy. Combination of 5-FU/Leucovorin/CPT-11 has demonstrated significantly better response rate than 5-FU/Leucovorin alone. Replacing 5-FU with oral capecitabine in combination with CPT-11 has emerged as a potentially more effective, safe and convenient treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer. Capecitabine is also well tolerated in concurrent treatment with radiation. Recent data has shown that preoperative radiation appears to be significantly more effective in increasing resectability rates.

This trial will investigate the activity of capecitabine and CPT-11 combination in the preoperative setting followed by chemoradiation with capecitabine in locally advanced rectal cancer to improve response and decrease local recurrence. We will also study whether TS, TP, DPD and carboxyesterase expressions correlate with the objective response rate with this chemotherapy and chemoradiation regimen.","['5-FU', 'Leucovorin', 'CPT-11', 'capecitabine']","['fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', '', 'capecitabine']"

NCT01718730,"The purpose of this study is to learn if measures of brain activity are different in children and adolescents with depression who are in different stages of treatment. This is important because it may identify a biological marker for depression that could one day be used to identify depressed children who would benefit from certain treatments (medications for example), or to monitor how well treatments are working. Brain activity measures(known as cortical excitability and inhibition) will be collected by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is a noninvasive (no surgery or implants) brain stimulation technology which can make parts of the brain work without putting any wires or chemicals into the body. Measurements will take place over one 3-hour visit. This study does not provide any form of treatment.
